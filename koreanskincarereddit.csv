Old routine that I was doing for a few months (bc I was broke and couldn‚Äôt afford my old products)/

I‚Äôve always used CeraVe foaming facial cleanser to wash off makeup or just wash my face in the morning and night. Never given me an issue. 

I‚Äôve been using Peach Slices Snail Rescue Blemish busting toner for awhile too and haven‚Äôt had an issue with it. 

And lastly I‚Äôd just put CeraVe moisturizing cream.

Recently I started using soonjung 2x barrier cream again, and started using (for the first time) beauty of Josean revive eye serum, and I‚Äôm from rice toner. 

So my routine right now is:

1. Wash my face in the am with cerave cleanser, rice toner, wait for it to dry.

2. beauty of josean eye cream, wait for it to dry, 

3. then the peach slices snail rescue, wait for it to dry, 

4. and end with the soonjung 2x cream.

 Sometimes I also add a layer of cerave cream on top after the 2x barrier cream but I haven‚Äôt done that in a bit

I wash my face and do the routine in the am, and before bed as well. So I do this 2x a day, and at night I put frownies on after too. 

Am I doing something wrong? 

I‚Äôve used the 2x barrier cream before and it never gave me issues. I used the peach slices snail rescue before without any issue. The only two really new products I‚Äôve incorporated is the eye serum and rice toner but I‚Äôm only flaky around my mouth. Could it be the toner? Or the snail rescue? Is 2x a day too much? Help!! I was really excited for this routine but it‚Äôs flaking my skin and is also kind of irritated. Again, it‚Äôs only around my mouth!",koreanskincare

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm kinda big noob in the skincare game and I‚Äôll explain my strange post title. 

I‚Äôm f21 and as of now, I don‚Äôt had many skin problems, appart a bit acne on teenage years, far from being annoyed by. And since I‚Äôm 18-19, I‚Äôm pretty much done with that without any treatment or specious skin care routine. 
Theses last weeks, I would like to have a better skin routine and I‚Äôve passed some hours to get know more about it. I‚Äôve bought 2 serums for ¬´¬†normal skin¬†¬ª, with good appreciations, good ingredients for doing the best and have a great glass skin like I see on social media (in a big part on TikTok or Pinterest if I‚Äôm totally honest, but with some cheaper products possibly üòÄ). It‚Äôs been one week I actually mix them with my own moisturiser cream and sunscreen two times a day, morning and night after cleaning my face but i don‚Äôt see any noticeable difference, in better or in worse. it‚Äôs weird, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just coincidence that‚Äôs my skin become a little bit textured by zone, or if I touched my face without very cleaned hands and so my skin react to ? Or if serums are juste bad for me and my skin.?. :/ 

I should say, I‚Äôm not really patient and If it would have noticeable good difference, when it comes, after how long does it have an effect?

1712530176.0,Thoughts on the COSRX Peptide Booster serum ?,"Hi I was curious if other people tried the COSRX peptide booster serum ?

So far I am using it as a ""pre toner"" product, as I often wash my face and don't put my skin care products immediatly after, especially in the morning, I would rinse my face, prepare my coffee and once it gets ready I would do my skincare routine. So I would use that peptide booster right after rinsing my face so it doesn't get too dry and so far my skin seem to love it. Most of the products I use are oriented towards hydratation and glow finish so I can't say if it did a difference but my skin seem to like this product well.

My skin type is combo, in summer it's more oily, in winter it tends to be more dry/dehydrated. I have been getting a lot of compliments on my skin recently, I don't think it is only due to it but I do think it helped to the overall look of my skin.

My routine is currently:

AM:

* rinse my face with water
* COSRX Peptide booster serum (then I usually do something else as my skin hates when I apply my products too quickly)
* Laneige Cerapeptide Toner or  Glow Recipe Cloud Berry Essence (depends on my mood)
* Serum Goodal Vita C
* Face cream Mary & May (if my skin is dryer I would use the black tube with Idebanone, if I feel my skin is plump enough with hydration I would use the green tube that is more of a gel (followed by spf if I go out)

PM:

* Belif face wash ( or I would double wash if I have lots of makeup/spf on)
* COSRX Peptide booster Serum
* Laneige Cerapeptide Toner or I'm From Fig Essence or Mary & May Black Berry Essence
* Serum Erborian Ginseng
* Face Cream Mary & May Idebanone ( sometimes I switch to one of the moisturizer from Belif)
* if needed I would add a night oil from Erborian, their ""Skin Therapy"" oil, but I rarely need it.

She has very sensitive skin, and because of that she‚Äôs prone to breaking out when products don‚Äôt work for her. She tends to have normal to dry skin, but like I mentioned before it‚Äôs been really dry these past few months.

I have been loving my Peach & Lily Matcha pudding moisturizer, however I am almost out of product . I saw on iHerb they are having a 20% off site wide today and was interested in the Klair‚Äôs water gel cream as a substitute. It is less expensive and you receive  more product compared to the Peach & Lily. I am also enticed due to the fact that I have been loving Klairs unscented supple preparation toner and their vitamin E mask that I use at night. 
Has anyone here with my similar skin type tried the gel water cream and the matcha pudding and have a preference? I use the matcha pudding moisturizer in the AM after my Mad Hippie vitamin C serum. Any information or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

I bought the BOJ Relief Sun : Rice + Probiotics a couple weeks ago here in Germany at the drugstore ""M√ºller"" (so a reputable seller, who sells original Products), it's like CVS in the US or Boots in the UK.

I noticed that the rice extract is all the way down in the ingredients list, and not as second ingredient as advertised on BOJ's official website. 

Did anyone else notice a change in formula or has the same packaging as I do? I highly doubt that a big drugstore like M√ºller would sell fake products. BTW, I couldn't scan the QR code to verify if it's authentic, because it was stuck over the small print and ripped when I tried to peel it off.

1712073640.0,2 things to consider when choosing a dermatology in Korea,"I‚Äôm a local Korean 
Went to over 20 different clinics probably closer to 40 (consultations and medications included) to treat acne, acne scars, pigments, enlarged pores. I probably had procedures done at about 10 different clinics. 

I would like to share a bit of my personal experience after spending thousands of dollars  on so many different clinics to treat my acne prone skin and pigments. But keep in mind that this is just from my personal experience, but also‚Ä¶ these are just really basic things all Korean locals would consider before choosing a dermatology but I noticed that most foreigners don‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ 

1. Make sure the dermatology has board certified dermatologists
 - This is probably the most basic & important thing to consider because getting your skin treated at a ‚Äúdermatology‚Äù without board certified dermatologists is just like getting plastic surgery from a family physician or a doctor who isn‚Äôt a specialist in plastic surgery or going to a gynecology run by a non board certified dermatologist.
- I realized this after seeing less improvements, getting deeper scarring and receiving risky acne prescriptions from NON board certified dermatologies

2. Check the kind of laser machine they have (this is the SECOND most important thing not the first)
You need to make sure that the dermatology machines are being used by someone who specializes in dermatology!!!

1711800280.0,I don't understand my skin anymore,"Hi, 22(f) here. I've used some skincare off and on before, but this time I really wanted to commit to it and take care of my skin a little better.

Without skincare I'd say I have combination skin, where my T-zone can be really dehydrated and flaky, but also greasy at the same time. My chin and jawline gets greasy easily as well and my cheeks can be just dry.

Well, I started a new skincare routine and at first my skin seemed so clear an moisturised. Before I started using some Korean skincare products I used two cleansers from cerave (the foaming cleanser and the oil water based cleanser) and my skinbarrier became really sensitive and irritated. Now I was already aware of my sensitive skin since some skincare I used before this could burn my skin as well. 

After this I thought my skin barrier was probably damaged and ordered some Korean skincare to hopefully fix it. Like I said, at first my skin became very clear and hydrated but after a while I started breaking out and noticing my T-zone getting VERY oily during the day. Unfortunately I haven't really been able to rule out what caused this; whether it was a certain product or just hormones or something. I stopped using my sunscreen a while (the boj one) but that didn't help. Then I stopped using my cerave foaming cleanser all at once and I thought it helped at first but it didn't.  

The skincare I use right now is:

AM
-roundlap moisturising cleanser (just bought that yesterday tho)
-purito panthenol rebarrier cream with low ph
-Beauty of Joseon sunscreen with rice prebiotics

PM
-Haruharu wonder oil cleanser
-Roundlap moisturising cleanser (just bought that yesterday tho)
-purito panthenol rebarrier cream with low ph

I'm a little afraid of using acids yet since I feel like I still have to restore my barrier.

My question is: any idea how I can solve my oily (mostly) nose and breakouts? Any idea which product it could be? 

(I thought it could be a sensitivity for niancenamide as well since it is in the moisturiser and the cerave cleanser I don't use anymore, since I've reacted to it before when I used the the ordinary niancenamide serum)

Any help will be greatly appreciated!!",koreanskincare

i went to a doctor: i live in dhaka where everyone is money opportunistic, people get ripped off easily i went to a dermatologist for the first time, i told her all my problems, then she prescribed some skincare products and recommended me to get a 4500tk treatment. which shocked me and i felt like the doc was trying to earn money then treating me. i just didn't say anything and left.

this are the products recommended by the doctor: acne bye soap, facid bt fugidal cream, safi blue moisture and the 4500tk treatment.

morning routine: i use saliclic acid neutrogena face wash with garnier meceller water, then i apply benzoyl peroxide and sometimes layer with ordinary niancinamide 10% with zinc. then end it with revolution skincare Thirsty Mood Quenching Moisture Gel if i am going out i apply benton mineral sunscreen

1711709596.0,[Review] Mania Holic Sunscreen Pack 50+ PA+++,"I bought this Korean sunscreen (made in Seoul) at Bologna Cosmoprof. I think this is my holy grail: it feels like I applied nothing on skin (and I have a very oily skin), plus it helps keeping sebum production under control: even after hours my face is not shiny or greasy at all.

Even reapplication is super simple, since the sunscreen does not pill and does not get sticky.

The producer claims something about hydrocolloidal films and some (bullshit?) like that. I don't know how much this is true, but the feeling is amazing, my skin is super smooth.

My concern is on its efficacy and safety: it'a new product, with no review at all, so I wonder if UVA/UVB protection is actually that good or not (remember Purito?).

Anyway, here's the link to producer website: [https://firstmarket2.cafe24.com/shop3/m/product/sunscrren-pack/141/category/116/display/1/](https://firstmarket2.cafe24.com/shop3/m/product/sunscrren-pack/141/category/116/display/1/)

I struggle a lot with my skin flushing a lot, it can look very similar to rosacea, so any advice on what I can get for that would be amazing. 

My skin is quite sensitive so if there's any good moisturizer with little to no perfume that someone could recommend to me I would love that.

I am also deeply in need of a good eye cream as I'm definitely seeing aging signs and I have quite thin skin there.

1710788975.0,Damaged skin barrier? Recommendations,"For the past couple of months I have noticed a quite drastic difference in my skin. I have had peeling, especially on my cheekbones. However, the biggest problem is the breakouts of blackheads and closed comedones all over my forehead. Also, all of my skincare has started to burn. The only way I can tolerate putting anything on my face without burning is by first applying organic aloe vera gel. 

As far as my current routine, I tend to rotate products based on what I think I need. For cleanser I have been using the la roche posay purifying foaming cleanser or the cosrx snail mucin one. For moisturizer I also use the cosrx snail mucin one or one of the la roche posay ones. However I noticed the most burning with those so I went back to the cerave moisturizing cream which seems to work a bit better. I sometimes use salycilic acid on my forehead because I thought it might help with the breakouts but I don‚Äôt necessarily see that it is making a difference and I fear it might be too drying? I‚Äôm also a big fan of pimple patches since I tend to be a picker as well (bad, I know). 

I saw a video on tiktok that made me think that the cause of these issues may be a damaged skin barrier? Maybe the winter weather dried my face out too badly and I didn‚Äôt realize it? 

If anyone can recommend me a better routine/products (or just general advice) I would really appreciate it! TIA ",koreanskincare

1710439507.0,How often do you switch your skincare products ?,"**For people who have more than the minimum of products, how often do you rotate/ switch between two products ? (skin type: combination, not sensitive)**

I love getting new products but I obviously can't use them all at the same time, I try to keep my routine with toner/essence + serum + moisturizer (aside from face wash and spf if i go out).

I have mostly a lot of choices in my toners/essences, but I often find myself unsure how to rotate them, so far I tried to use the same ones and whenever I feel like it I would switch to another one, while keeping the ones for day and night.

**Those are the 7 toners/essences I have for example:**

\- I'm From Fig Boosting Essence ( I use it at night especially in winter)

\- Laneige Cerapeptide Mist ( I use it in the morning or through the day if my skin need a boost)

\-  Sollala Multi Vitamin Refresh Toner ( it's a brightening product so I think to keep it for the morning)

\- Epona Birch Juice Premium (I haven't tried it enough to have an idea)

\- COSRX 6 Peptide Boosting Serum (it says serum but also to use it as a 1st step so I use it in my toner/essence stage, I use it sometimes in the day or at night since I have more time)

\- Mary & May Black Berry Complex Cream Essence ( I haven't tried it long enough)

\- Glow Recipe Cloud Berry Bright ( I haven't tried it long enough either)

**How would you rotate those ? Should I just select one for day and another for night and just change whenever I feel like it, or should I try to stick to the same ones for a month or so to have some results ? (ps: my skin is quite good for the moment, I don't have any major issues I am expecting huge change, it's more for maintenance, aside from some pimples sometimes but nothing too bad).**",koreanskincare

1710362912.0,Is it normal for the Roundlab Dokdo Toner to tingle? ,"Hello! My HG Acwell Licorice Toner has mysteriously disappeared from Stylevana‚Äôs site. On my hunt for a new toner, I came across Roundlab‚Äôs.

Heard raving reviews, stylevana had a buy 2 get 1 free promotion event. It was too good to not buy!

I had known it had protease and sugarcane but everyone kept saying the exfoliation was super gentle and okay for daily use. I thought my sensitive skin (who HATES Salicylic acid) would be able to handle it (it can handle retinoid and Vit C just fine)

But now I‚Äôve tried it on for the first time and my face tingled as if I added retinoids on. 
To be safe, I left out any other actives usually in my routine. My face still feels tingly, is this normal or is my skin just having a bad day? (Sometimes my face tingles and is more sensitive for no reason, even when I‚Äôve used no active at all)

Also, would it be safe to use this toner with Beauty of Joseon‚Äôs 20% Vit C (alternative)?

Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Pads - So far these have been amazing!! I have been using them as mini sheet masks and the hydration is unreal, I highly recommend.

Round Lab Birch Juice Sunscreen - (repurchase) I love this sunscreen, its like a second moisturizer. My dry skin loves it. My favorite sunscreen so far and I have tried quite a few.

Amplen Ceramide Shot Ampoule - Haven't tried this yet, testing it out on my hand it is a bit sticky but definitely very hydrating 

Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum - Been using this for a few days now, its great! But I think the round lab is still my favorite.

ILLIYOON Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream- (repurchase) This is very heavy and great to seal everything in, but I actually don't consider it to be very hydrating, just good at sealing in moisture from other products

MEDI-PEEL Extra Super 9+ 2.0 - Haven't tried this yet, but i cannot wait to!

Olive Young Care Plus Spot Cover Spot Patch-- 102 patches!! Cant pass that up, plus I have heard great things

BIODANCE Hydro Cera-Nol Real Deep Mask Sheet-- My influenced purchase, I love anything with extreme hydration!

acropass Trouble Cure - Haven't tried these yet but I love microdart patches for deep pimples and wanted to try a new brand, these come with a cleansing step!",koreanskincare

I currently use a local salicylic acid facewash, nuetrogena hydro boost water gel, skinaqua sunscreen and a 0.5% adaplene gel given by a derm at night. Sometimes I use the pixi vitamin c toner.

I have comedonal acne, oily, textured skin but it dries out a bit where I use the gel. I am south asian and have some pigmentation as well as spots from acne. Currently I get acne very less as compared to before a derm gave me the above routine but I randomly get white pimples and I've never had completely clear skin.

I am currently thinking:
-Add oil cleanse step with the Klairs Gentle Black Fresh cleansing oil
-Same local facewash of salicylic acid (please lmk if there's a suggestion)
-Add a toner (I am confused with which one and should I focus on hydration or exfoliation, I am currently leaning towards a hydrating one but I have no idea which.)
-Use the mixsoon bean essence
-Use Axis Y Dark Spot Correcting Glow Serum
-Same moisturiser (or if i should use smth else)

I've also heard great things about the Cocokind chlorophyll discoloration serum. I've also seen people use Anua heartleat toner pads with the jelly and exfoliation side for hyperpigmentation.

I would really appreciate any suggestions for an AM/PM routine. I've gotten bits and pieces from South Asian skincare creators online but ofc not one thing fits all. But I'd appreciate any guidance either way.

i started getting tiny pimples on my forehead and chin (and temples) and when i ran out of the torriden serum and stopped using it, the pimples almost completely disappeared. 

so i would like to have a recommendation of serums to buy another one. this one from torriden was dive in low molecular hyaluronic acid

1709686527.0,Review of Illyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream,"I never ever write reviews but I feel like this product deserves a huge shoutout.

I‚Äôve always had combination oily skin.  But now that I‚Äôm in my mid 40s my skin has just become all over dry.  However, I have never ever had any sensitivity to any products regardless of ingredients or scents. But I must have finally come in contact with the one product that my skin does not love, although I have still not figured out what exactly it is. My under eyes and eyelids all of a sudden became extremely red, dry, inflamed and burned with every product I applied.  Since I don‚Äôt know what caused it I decided to cut out all actives and just go back to the basics.  I did a ton of research and decided to try the Avene eye contour cream to help and hopefully heal my irritation.  While I did notice VERY minimal improvement each day that passed while using the Avene eye cream, the improvement was extremely slow and not doing what I had hoped it would do.  

So I went back to doing more research and decided to purchase the Illyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream, and all I have to say is HOLY COW.  I used it the very first night I received it on my face,including my under eyes and eyelids, and when I woke up the very next morning, ALL irritation was 100% gone.  No redness, no burning, no inflammation, no itching!  It had all disappeared overnight like magic. Plus the moisture this provided was just incredible. Like I said, my skin became dry as I got older and I finally found my cure.  This product will forever be in my skincare line up.  I cannot recommend this product enough.  

I know everyone‚Äôs skin is different and may not react the same way as someone else‚Äôs but I write this in hopes of helping someone who may be going through the struggles I did, this product is worth a shot.  For me it was a miracle in a bottle.  ",koreanskincare

after almost one month of using most of the items i'm doing a review cause why not (there will be lots of beauty of joseon productscause the first time i got into korean skincare it was the first brand that popped up on my feed. I am now aware of all the other brands lol)
 
I have normal to dry skin with a slightly oiler t-zone. Unfortunately despite all the skincare i have lots of tiny bumps and red spots on my face. i recently ordered the isntree BHA 2% essence to try some exfoliation, i'll let you know how it is when the package arrives. 

CLEANSERS 
Boj ginseng cleaning oil: i like the fact that it doesn't have a smell and doesn't leave a film. It leaves my skin quite clean, but it cannot get rid of my sebaceous filaments, so i'll try another oil cleanser next time. Takes a whooooole lot to use the whole bottle, like 3 months. Overall it's pretty meh.

Boj green plum cleanser: this one is nice, really gentle, makes my skin clean and doesn't strip. But i think next time i'll buy the round lab dokdo cleanser cause i heard so many good reviews about it and i love that brand. 


TONER 
i'm from rice toner: it does everything a toner should do: hyrdates your skin, and gives a nice glow. A bit pricey tho :/ but that's fine. 

SERUM 
Boj glow serum: it makes my skin glowing (ig it really lives up to his name lol) and that's it. After 3 weeks use along with the toner i definitely noticed a glowier skin tho. 

MOISTURISER
Boj dynasty cream: mmmh i'm not sure about this one. Sometimes it leaves my skin a bit tight, and i'm afraid this product might be the cause of the many bumps and smalll pimples i have on my skin, they appeared a few days ago and i've used the cream for more than one month. I recently ordered the round lab birch juice moisturiser, i'll update you about it 

SUNSCREEN 
Roundlab birch juice moisturising sunscreen: if perfection would be embodied in a sunscreen, it would be the birch juice moisturising sunscreen. Literally perfect, flawless. Hydrates my skin, doesn't leave a white cast, and makes my skin so smooth. Some people even complimented my skin because of this sunscreen's effect, it felt awesome. 

MASK
Boj red bean pore mask: it feels like it doesn't do anything to my skin. really. i think my skin prefers clay masks. 

I hope this helps! Let me know your opinions and concerns! I'd love to hear some recommendations from you guys! have a great day and clear skin <3",koreanskincare

1709548110.0,How to rotate Toner/Essences when they have similar actions ?,"&#x200B;

I really love toners and essences, I think they are my favorite step of my skincare. I recently ordered a skincare box and ended up with a couple more essences. So now I am a bit unsure how to maybe rotate them, so far I just used whatever I felt like using that day as they have similar actions. It's not in the picture but I also have the Belif toner, Laneige Cerapeptide (my favorite with the Fig Essence of I'm From) and the Multi Vitamin Toner from Sollalla.

**I have combination skin, not sensitive but reactive sometimes if I am very stressed/apply my products without letting them fully sink in or if the tab water is too hard**.

So far my routine used to be, regarding the toner/Essences step, to use in the morning Laneige Cerapeptide and in the evening the Fig Essence.

I finished my Laneige toner so in the morning I kind of switched every day what I used. But I am trying to use this week for example in the morning the Mugwort Essence (and still the Fig Essence at night).

They all have anti aging/hydrating/pore care/ brightening... properties.

How do you suggest I could rotate my products ?

I was thinking maybe to have period when I could use **I'm From Fig Essence+ Mugwort Essence**, and another time to use instead the **Epona Premium Birch Juice + COSRX 6 Peptide Booster**",koreanskincare

Same toner from the morning.

I then have to wash my face, use a micellar water to rinse the tab water and then sprit some of my favorite mist from Caudalie.

I noticed however that my skin react less in products in a mist (as I don't have to rub them in my skin).

So I know I will 100% bring my Laneige Cerapeptide toner in a mist HOWEVER I wanted to try if my skin could agree with I'm From Mugwort Essence, but I don't know if it is because it is thicker than the Laneige one, but in the same type of mist bottle, the product just come so aggressively ,I feel the bottle just spit on my face instead of having a nice fine mist.

I've been using the Cosrx propolis toner for quite a while now (I'm probably at my 3rd bottle) and I've recently repurchased a new bottle but I noticed it has a weird smell to it (quite hard to describe the smell üòü). I don't remember the other bottles to have a smell like this or any smell at all, but this was like a slap in the face when I have first tried it. I was wondering if you perhaps experienced the same or if maybe they have changed the formula.

1707713369.0,Is MISSHA discontinuing their Super Aqua Ice Tear line?,"Hello, 

I‚Äôve been using the emulsion for 5+ years. I consider this an ESSENTIAL in my skin care routine, partly because of the sentimentality (my first Korean skin care product) and how it‚Äôs been unproblematic for me all these years. I‚Äôve never switched nor experimented moisturizers. Why fix something that‚Äôs not broken right? 

Well now, my heart is broken because MISSHA at my hometown told me the line is being discontinued (or the product at least). I was wondering where I can buy these? I saw the product being sold on Amazon, but they do not ship to where I‚Äôm at. Is this product still being made or is the company genuinely discontinuing the product? 

Lastly, if the worst happens and there is a discontinuation, are there any products you guys know that are just like it? (Similar ingredients & all.)

Please help! 

I'm trying to get more into Korean skincare, but with all of the options and advice, i'm finding it difficult to know where to start.

I have sensitive oily/combination, acne prone skin with large pores, and have those stubborn blackheads on my nose and chin area. I also get dark under eye circles and some redness at times.

I'm currently using the Cosrx Snail Mucin Essence which is ok, but i don't think it's having it's fair shot alongside the other products i'm already using.

I use the himalaya neem cleanser atm which is a bit too stripping and I use a lot of the ordinary, so salicylic acid, niacinamide and retinol, i switch it up on different nights. I also use the hyaluronic acid in the mornings.

I'm thinking the Anua cleansing oil, cream cleanser and the toner? Any advice, recommendations would be amazing! A moisturiser recommendation would be amazing too! As i'm always petrified of them because most times an extra moisturiser breaks me out.

P.S over all my skin is ok, i just want it to be optimal and more consistent, rather than every other day theres an issue!

In the last 3 months or so I‚Äôve started skin cycling. As I‚Äôve been slowly experimenting, I did find that it was really important for me to very deeply hydrate in between and on recovery days, but I still almost always have one or two large and inflamed pimples on my chin, as well as lots of textured bumps (whiteheads?).

1706854057.0,New hair care find.,"I've been thinking about switching from hair masks to using just hair oil lately. I've read that oils can really nourish your hair from the inside out, and the masks just feel a bit too heavy for me. My hair is on the weaker side, especially with all the blow-drying and ironing I do for work. I need something that not only protects but also gives my hair a boost of strength.    


I bought a new hair oil from Mediall on Amazon, the reviews are good, but I was worried about the brand because it's new to me, I bought it anyway because it's the same manufacturer as the Korean cosmetics I usually use. The price was reasonable, and the scent lasted longer on my hair than I thought it would.

I have pretty good skin, I never get pimples so when they suddenly show up that means I did something wrong. However, it is extremely sensitive even before it was damaged so I get REALLY anxious whenever trying a new product.

My routine is only cetaphil cleanser, the ordinary HA serum, anua toner every other day (bought this to soothe my damaged skin but i was slightly purging with whiteheads and ccs but probaby bc of not exfoliating too), and cerave moisturizer.

I mostly struggle with texture, redness and unevenness. 

I am hoping to get some advice on what products I can use on a daily basis together as well as morning vs. evening. I am also open to any/all suggestions to add, remove or adjust within my routine. 

I have the basics outlined: 

1. **Oil cleanser** (Evening) - I got 2 different types to try them both out
2. **Water-based cleanser** (Morning/Evening) - Isntree Green Tea Fresh Cleanser
3. ***Exfoliate/Toner/Essence/Ampoule*** *- This is where I need advice*
4. **Moisturizer -** Gel cream in morning and intensive barrier cream in evening
5. **SPF (**Morning) - Trying out 2 different recommendations 

*Jumiso All Day Vitamin Brightening & Balancing Facial Serum*  
*Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner*  
*COSRX Full Fit Propolis Synergy Toner*  
*COSRX Snail Mucin Essence*

I have a combination skin, not sensitive but sometimes reactive, I live most of the year in a cold climate and other in a hot humide one. I won't review the european products aside if someone ask for it in the comment as it may be out of this sub:

\- Belif Face wash: One of my favorite face wash, it smell so fresh and leaves my skin really good.

\- Isntree Mugwort calming mask: It's okay. I think I need a stronger products as it didn't do much for my black heads.

\- Belif Toner: It is my 3rd bottle, I often go back to a lot of Belif products as I love the brand on my skin, but it's quite pricy in my country so I always wait the sales. It is quite moisturizing especially in the summer and again I love the smell.

\- I'm From Rice Toner: I haven't tried it for super long but it's not my favorite from the brand, it is very moisturizing though. I probably won't buy it again.

\- I'm From Fig Essence: My favorite product from the brand !! I know it didn't got as much love as the Mugwort or the rice toner but I absolutely love it. I like my products to have a nice smell and sadly for me it doesn't smell of anything. The packaging is lovely too and since the products is not cheap I appreciate to have a pretty product at least, it makes me enjoy the experience even more. It is VERY moisturizing but I haven't got more pimples surprisingly as I have an acne prone skin. And it gives me an amazing glow. So far I only use it an night.

\- Klairs Midnight calming blue cream: I haven't tried it for very long and my skin didn't reacted to anything so far so I didn't used it to notice calming effects so I may update the post later.

\- Abib Heartleaf calming pads : Love the packaging, but I didn't noticed a huge calming effect on my skin. It is a nice toner pads to use in lazy mornings though.

\- Belif moisturizer : I have the vitamin C and the original cream I love them both very much, they smell amazing and don't irritate my skin, they are the face creams I often go back to.

\- Some By Me Retinol Intense serum: I haven't noticed any change in my fine lines so far but the retinol in it didn't irritated me at all. The bottle is beautiful too BUT I find it very hard to get the product, I don't know if it's because it is thick or the pipette thing that doesn't get enough products.

\- Kahi Multi Balm and Aqua Balm : I love them ! They are expensive for the quantity and there is probably cheaper option out there but I don't use mine every day and I have them for quite a long time. As you noticed the packaging and smell of a product is important to me, a bland bottle with 0 smell makes me give up skincare very quickly. And they look really pretty and smell great, also it is really good to moisturize some parts of the face that turns dry. I don't use them all over my face (except the Aqua balm which is a SPF 50 I love to use it especially around my eyes) but the multi balm except some colder days in winter I would use it on some small parts of my face. I think I would buy them again !

\- Round Lab sunscreen: I love it, it is very light and doesn't sting my face like a lot of SPF creams

\- Laneige Mist bottle: Loved it too, it is empty now but I plan to buy more. When I bought it I didn't had high expectations as while reading the main ingredients it wasn't anything clear to me like the I'm From products which have rice, figs, mugwort, pears... so I was confused what the Laneige really had or if it would really do something. Surprinsingly I worked great for me, I feel I could spray it in the hot summer and be good in the day, no serum, no cream! So far it's winter so I use it as a regular toner and I really liked it. It worked better at calming my skin also than a lot of heartleaf and cica products.

\- Belif Cica cream: I didn't liked it so much, it must be the Belif product I liked the less... The packaging is great but I don't like the smell at all, it doesn't have the same smell as any of the other products. Also it didn't calmed my skin during irritated times. I don't think Cica really do much for me honestly.

\- Soo Good pads: They are very nice as a mask but the jar takes a lot of place and I wish it had a more elegant look as the Abib ones. I don't like the smell of it very much though..

\- Heimish All Clean balm Mandarin: very nice balm, smell like orange tree flower (I prefer the Banila Co Orange cleansing balm though which smelled like a fresh orange juice !)

\- Goodal Vitamin C serum: LOVE IT the smell just put me in such a great mood in the morning and gives a great glow as most vitamin C serums. I do find the pump is a bit hard to push.

\- Erborian Oil: It feels nice ( I am not a fan of oils in general but it is a good one).

\- Erborian Ginseng serum: LOVE IT, I also loved their Yuzu serums but they are so expensive... Bottle is beautiful, products smells great and you can see results so fast !!!",koreanskincare

Dokdo 1025 cleanser once a day

I do a manuka honey mask for 20 mins pretty much daily 

Then soon Jung 2x barrier moisturizer 


Recently I been eyeing more round lab products because all of these Korean products overwhelm me and I want to keep things simple

I‚Äôve been thinking of trying the soybean line or the birch juice line because I think the dokdo 1025 might be a tad drying for me.. 

And I‚Äôm getting frustrated because I just want a simple routine and not a 10 step routine and I only get dry flaky skin around my mouth .. the honey seems to help 

And I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs  perioral dermatitis because it‚Äôs not red or itchy. 

I also do exfoliate one a week or trying to with grinded up natural oats and makuna honey.. which I think helps

But I‚Äôm just lost and don‚Äôt know what to do or add to my skincare routine

1706201555.0,What is your favorite I'm From toner/essence and why ?,"Age: 29 years old , Skin type: Combination (reactive sometimes but not sensitive)

So I bought all 3 essences/toner from the brand I'M FROM, and I would like to stick with 2 of them for morning/night skincare or ideally only one. So far I only tested the Rice Toner and Fig essence, I ordered the Mugwort one but I haven't received it yet. Here are my thoughts so far:

\- Fig Essence: I'm on my 2nd bottle, I think it is really my favorite, I have been using it in the evening only as it is a bit think. It doesns't has any smell which is a bit of a downside for me as I love my prodcuts to have a pleasent smell, it really helps me to relax while I do my skincare. The packaging is also beautiful. I got it on sale but the product is not cheap at full price so I really like that the bottle looks pretty. It moisturize really well and gave me beautiful glow

\- Rice Toner: I haven't tried it for as long as the Fig Essence but so far I like it too but not as much, I haven't noticed a huge difference with my skin but at the same time my skin is quite good at the moment so there is not much to ""fix"", the bottle is in plastic (while the Fig and Mugwort essences are in a glass bottle). I know some people were able to smell a slight rice smell from it but personally I can't smell anything on it. It moisturize well too and I liked the feeling of my skin after it. I didn't had the ""wow"" effect I had with the Fig essence but I barely saw people talking about the Fig one while all the rave is about the Rice toner hahaha

I will update about the Mugwort essence once I receive it and try it for a couple of weeks, my skin is sometimes reactive, not to ingredients but to ""situations"" so if I have been stressed out or if I'm in a rush and apply my products too quickly without waiting for each products to sink in fully, then I would get some red itchy areas on my face, that usually go away by themself after 30min or if I rinse off my face. So I was hoping the Mugwort Essence may help during those times (though so far my holy grail to calm my skin then is the Eau de Raisin from Caudalie but during winter it doesn't hydrate enough).

But I was curious, which one of those products are your favorite and why ? ( please if you can refer your skin type as well).",koreanskincare

I haven't started using Korean products yet but I will soon. As I'm acne prone/combo oily, I was suggested to double cleanse with a gel cleanser instead of oil. For that, I purchased a Cosrx low pH gel cleanser and Etude Soon Jung whip cleanser
I dont know how much of each to use and how to apply it. I do tend to use too much of my current cleanser sometimes because I have a fear that I need a lot to clear out the oily gunk but then I end up drying my skin out too much and I fear that I will do the same with the double cleansing.

 Additionally, I also started to use SPF, as well as slug with Vaseline at night to help my barrier. (I did that a while ago after trying to use a small amount of my current cleanser but I don't know if my SPF is still on my face) I need a technique to remove these products without having to dry out my skin, but without oil cleansing.

I‚Äôm 19F and going to preface this by saying i‚Äôm new to Korean skincare / beauty and don‚Äôt know much, but that being said i just finished a 6 month round of Accutane and am looking for product recommendation/advice! Beforehand I had oily skin and struggled with acne and scarring. Now however I‚Äôm more Normal to Oily and mostly struggle with scarring from acne with occasional small acne but very rarely. The acne I get now is more small bumps under the skin which go away within 2 days. I‚Äôm also concerned about any extra oil that may be on my face as I still produce some oil and want to try and control that as well if possible. 

I‚Äôm looking for products to help with the scarring and fading them. As well as preventing new acne, something that I can use daily for both or most days out of the week. I‚Äôm thinking also an exfoliator or a toner with aha and bha to help open and clear pores as well but I‚Äôm willing to try things that don‚Äôt have that as well! 

Currently I‚Äôm using the Advanced Night Repair from Est√©e Lauder and Moisture surge from Clinique but I love both these products and want to keep them in my routine, however if there is something that is better i‚Äôm completely willing to try those too, these are just some things that have been working for me. I do have the snail mucin from Cosrx which is also nice and i‚Äôve been using that about 2/3 times a week. I‚Äôm mostly looking for just a toner or exfoliator and some serums to help me with any acne and scarring as well as to help control oil. Also I don‚Äôt know if i should be using something for skin barrier? I‚Äôve tried a Dr.Jart moisturizer that I loved while I was on Accutane just not sure if it‚Äôs 100% needed as I‚Äôm no longer on it and I‚Äôm not sure if it would be to heavy?

1705724990.0,I'm confused about my skin barrier and I don't know if I should buy an exfoliant,"Hi! As a complete beginner to korean skincare (and skincare routine in general tbh) I've seen that you should exfoliate chemically (use AHA/BHA) once/twice a week so your skincare absorbs well, but I also heard that it's not good to use actives on damaged skin barriers. After doing a bit of research, I'm very confused about my skin barrier.

I don't have extreme skin conditions, just quite a few acne scars, hyperpigmentation, texture, etc. Usually I have combination to oily acne prone skin but it tends to get dry because of the weather rn. I haven't established any sort of routine yet, I'm still in the process of developing one and buying things so the only things I use rn are a cetaphil cleanser, neutrogena toner & a nivea moisturizer

After cleansing and waiting for around 10 minutes, I feel dryness in my skin and if I smile or stretch my skin a little it feels very crusty and dry and it hurts quite a bit. When I apply my toner after cleansing, it stings quite a bit the first time. I'm not sure if this is because of the seasonal dryness or if its because I have a damaged skin barrier, or even if it's because I use too much product (I always single cleanse and I use around 4-5 pumps and massage for around 1 minute).

1704917651.0,My Lamiche Experience,"I visited Seoul 2 weeks ago and visited Lamiche clinic while there. I wanted to share my experiences and also open up the chance for yall to ask questions :)

I found Lamiche through social media searching for skincare clinics. They seemed to have a very good reputation and I found many Tiktoks/Insta reels by foreigners. I do speak Korean but my husband does not so I was interested in places that worked with foreigners quite frequently.

**PRE-VISIT!** I initially contacted Lamiche via Kakao Talk. I always do this because I know places often charge foreigners different prices, and I felt the a bit iffy about not finding any prices in English. Once they realized I was not Korean, I was shuttled over to their foreigner account and was provided their package pricing. I didn't think anything of the package model at first, however I realized during the sales consultation at the clinic how ridiculous it is. More on that later. I did like that they were receptive about my concerns regarding laser treatments and my skin color, and they asked for photos of my face before confirming in advance that I could receive laser treatments.

**DOCTOR'S CONSULTATION!** The visit started out well. They did skin imaging after which I met with the sales rep/translator who did a basic intro of skin health and acne. The doctor came in for maybe 5 minutes and just explained areas that we would benefit from treatment.

**SALES CONSULTATION!** We were called into an office with the sales rep/translator and presented charts with what the doctor recommended. I forgot my tax bracket and accepted everything the doctor recommended. In total I spent 5k won. I was offered a discount (sorry I don't remember how much) in exchange for posting on social media which I accepted (this is my post - sorry Lamiche). They also came back a third time and offered me botox and threads for free which I refused and honestly found very weird because I was very clear at the beginning that I did not want those at all.

Back to the  pricing, Lamiche has package options for foreigners (pricing for Koreans is different). One laser was about 300k won, the the price of the individual laser went down the more lasers/treatments you purchased. For example, purchasing 8 lasers led to an individual price of about 100k won. However, charging 300k won for one laser without knowing individual pricing means they can charge you 300k for a laser that is worth less than what you are paying. My husband only wanted one or two laser so I was frantically googling what would be the best bang for his buck. They did not provide a pricing list for individual lasers/injections.

That being said, definitely hem and haw. At the end of the day, it's sales and they are willing to a little give and take. I wish I asked for them to do more neck treatments.

**AFTERCARE INSTRUCTIONS!** Once consultation and payment was done, I was given a verbal list of aftercare instructions. Most of it I don't remember tbh and I had to keep texting them in the following weeks to ask if this or that was ok. I remember they said no actives for 2 months, but when I texted, they said one month. I think it would be really helpful for the clinic to provide written aftercare instructions. But for now, it would be good to go ready to take some notes.

**PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS!** My husband and I were both prescribed medications that would could fill across the street. We were prescribed some antibiotics, melanin inhibitors, etc. The sales consultant/translator asked if we were taking any medications and I mentioned broadly some medications I took (think saying antibiotics instead of saying doxycycline). He said ""oh thats fine"" and I was like ok great. However, after getting home, I realized like wait, he's not a doctor and he didn't even ask about my specific medications. My medication is prone to interactions so I tried to find interactions online but I could not find the medications they prescribed.  So I texted the clinic and asked again. After checking with the doctor, the doctor said ""check with your US doctor to make sure you can take the medications since they prescribed your medication"". SIR??? YOU PRESCRIBED THESE TO ME! The doctor should have absolutely checked what medication I was taking in detail before even writing a prescription. This feels like medical malpractice issue ready to happen. I ended up not taking the medications because it was Christmas holiday and I could not get in touch with my US doctor.

**TREATMENT!** Then I was sent down to the the treatment floor. The treatment process was insane. First off, don't let anyone lie to you, that shit HURTS. My husband heard people screaming (the staff said it was common) and he cancelled some procedures half way through his treatment. The doctor wanted me to take a numbing injection in my butt because I was going to have so many procedures but I really didn't want that so they topically numbed my face with cream twice and injections 2-3 times. In retrospect, I am glad I refused the butt shot because again, they did not check any of my medical history to make sure that would be safe for me. Even with all the numbing it hurt although I found most tolerable. The Ulthera laser was the absolute worst, and I was getting treatments from roughly 5pm to 11pm. They did give me a really nice vibrating spikey ball to help distract me from the pain. They did come to me mid procedure (pre-Ulthera hell) and offered me a discount on something on my neck and I was like fuck it, let's do it. But the staff were great, especially once they found out I could speak Korean. The male doctor doing most of the procedures chatted with me (as much as I could manage) and the nurses were lovely too. There was also a female translator who stuck around until 11pm when my treatment was done and she was lovely! Shout out to her. I hope she got paid overtime.

**POST TREATMENT!** After bandaging up my injection points, I was ready to go home. Personally, I feel like you pay 5k and are at the clinic until 11pm, I think they should at least call you a cab but that just me. We left and grabbed fried chicken nearby in a place that was popping, before heading home after hailing a cab. Under my chin was definitely very sore as they said but otherwise I felt fine. I had some skin tenderness so I couldn't not use pressure when washing my face but that went away after about 3 days.  I'll be honest - with all the crazy stuff they did to my skin, I am still in awe that I did not get/need painkillers to take home. That being said my skin was SO dry and the products they gave were not at all hydrating enough. I ended up doing an Olive Young run to buy products because my skin was so so dry. 2 weeks out, I still have some numbness under my chin but otherwise feel totally fine. My husband came out with some crazy skin bruising under his chin (he said they were making a v-line) but I can't speak much for that since I wasn't there for his treatment.

**RESULTS!** That being said, their lasers/procedures definitely work. My skin is so much clearer and smoother, but I do not see much brightening. That being said, I didn't expected not to get blackheads two weeks after the service but maybe that was  just poor knowledge on my part. In any case, double cleansing cleans them away so so easily now, although my pores are the ""same size"" (no change in appearance).  The fat reduction treatments have me a bit skeptical as I do not see any changes yet and under my chin is still pretty numb. My husband's skin is so clear and however his redness has just started returning the past few days. Overall very happy at this point.

**TLDR;** However, the procedures are incredibly painful but the results speak for themselves. I will be getting procedures done again my next visit to Seoul but at a different clinic with more transparent pricing.

1704896213.0,Skin oily after skincare,"Hi all, 
18 male here, I have normal skin type so I don‚Äôt produce a lot of oils. On the days when I feel lazy and perhaps don‚Äôt wash my face or only use water, cleanser and moisturiser my face is nice and matte. 

But anytime I make an attempt to improve my skin by adding more products, my T-zone, nose especially, gets really shiny and oily.

This is my current skincare routine, or the one I‚Äôm trying to stick to but get get oily:

AM
- don‚Äôt use cleanser, just wash with water

Toner - ANUA Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner

Serum - Anua Peach 70% Niacinamide Serum

Moisturiser - Cerave Daily Moisturising Lotion

SPF - Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotic SPF50+

PM

Oil Cleanser - SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Light Cleansing Oil

Cleanser - CeraVe Foaming Cleanser for Normal to Oily Skin

Exfoliant - Paula‚Äôs Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant (every two days)

Toner - ANUA Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner

Essence - MIXSOON Bean Essence

Serum - Anua Peach 70% Niacinamide Serum

Moisturiser - Cerave Daily Moisturising Lotion


My thoughts:
- My moisturiser is too thick maybe and it makes me look shiny
- The spf I use also makes me shiny and not matte although I heard good reviews online 
- I‚Äôve used different products but this problem has always happened when I try to make an effort in skincare my fave always gets oily and shiny


In terms of skin hydration I really can‚Äôt tell the difference between when my skin is hydrated or if products are making me oily. I like the feeling of toner and water, but hate the stickiness of the glow essence

Can anyone help with this, and don‚Äôt suggest blotting paper, cos I‚Äôm sure that the problem is stemming from a product",koreanskincare

I used only Alumier MD, Image Skincare (medical grade western products) and some of DECIEM The Ordinary, but found it didn‚Äôt help my skin anymore as I seemed to have reached a plateau. I washed twice daily with an oil cleanser, during the day applied HA serum and SPF moisturizer and at night an eye cream + 10% azelaic acid.  

I tried the following 10 steps routine (all at once after doing patch tests - I know this might have been a mistake!) since January 1st:

1. Heimish all clean balm oil cleanser 
2. Soonjung etude 5.5 foam cleanser
3. Bio-peel gauze peeling green tea (twice a week)
4. Pyunkang Yul essence toner 
5. I‚Äôm from Mugwort essence 
6. Cosrx propolis light ampoule 
7. Real nature hydrating masks (every other day)
8. Benton fermentation eye cream
9. Pyunkang Yul calming moisture barrier cream
10. Coola sun silk SPF 30 drops

I also got a LED EMS wand that I used twice on the red light setting after applying a hydrating mask. 

I absolutely LOVE doing the routine, it‚Äôs almost therapeutic, but my skin flares up after and I‚Äôm scared this isn‚Äôt normal! I feel it happens after the toner / essence stage. 

First pic - January 1st before starting 
Second pic - January 6th after morning routine (I got scared and washed my face again to remove the products)

1704241944.0,Korean Skincare Recs & Retailers - as a Newbie,"Hi all, I'm very new to Korean skincare, literally just starting out. I've read articles, watched tik tok videos, and read through skincare subs such as this to gather as much info as I can. I have to admit it has been overwhelming, but also very exciting on this journey of self care. 

 I'm trying to create a good list of reputable Korean skincare retailers that will ship to the U.S. The below is what I have gathered so far. The reason for this post is two fold:

1)  Can you take a look at the below list and add any I might have missed, and/or share which ones you have had the best experience with, best shipping speeds, and/or best sales and deals. 

2) I have very sensitive, very dry skin, with rosacea redness. When my skin gets irritated, my rosacea flares causing a few hives, these hives turn into little whiteheads the next day, if left untreated they turn into scars. I am however not acne prone. This only happens with rosacea flares when some product doesn't agree with me/stress/other irritant. Do you have any holy grail product recommendations for my skin type? I also find that my skin needs mild exfoliation more frequently or it just starts to look very dull. Although I only try to exfoliate 1-2x a week, something gentle that can still keep me radiant on a more frequent basis could help me. 

If you've read this far, thank you so much! Below is the retailers list I've compiled:

*Olive & Young
*Jolse
*Soko Glam
*Style Korean
*Yes Style
*Blooming Koco
*Live K-Beauty
*Olive Kollection
*Kiyoko",koreanskincare

I do have some little bumps on the forehead and some black/whiteheads on the nose that I want to get rid of. I haven‚Äôt received all my products yet so this is my current skincare routine.

&#x200B;

**current**:

facewash: neutrogena ultra gentle daily cleanser

toner: tirtir milk skin 

essence: cosrx snail muccin (I wait a little bit before putting it on after my toner)

serum: vitamin c dr althea

eye gel/cream: (**i Got this from urban outfitters lol)** byoma vita c eye gel 

***wait a little bit***

moisturizer: Olay active hydration

sunscreen: Etude 

&#x200B;

***my skincare routine when I receive the rest of my products***

***MORNING***

facewash: same as before

toners: Anua heartleaf, Isntree hyaluronic acid, Tirtir milk 

***wait***

essence: same as before

serums: anua peach niacinamide, **WAIT** dr Althea vitamin c serum

eye gel/cream: same as before

moisturizer: same as before

sunscreen: same 

&#x200B;

(**ig my main concern here is the hyaluronic acid toner before the niacinamide and vita c serums. (If its okay to use in that order**) Also ik using both niacinamide and vita c can sometimes have bad effects but thats why when layering, im gonna wait a while in between those two serums. I don‚Äôt really wanna do alternating days.)

&#x200B;

my **current** night routine is the same as my **current** morning routine except without sunscreen

(my night routine once the rest of my products come in would hopefully be the same as what my morning routine would be, except that I would double cleanse with *kose speedy oil cleanser* and wouldnt use the vitamin c serum or eye gel. Just the niacinamide serum along with a *retinal eye cream (beauty of Joseon).*   


and going back to the little bumps I have on my forehead, **I was wondering if the anua heart leaf toner would be enough to get rid of the minor texture I have.** Because I wanted an exfoliating toner but not a super harsh one and I heard that the anua had exfoliating properties that were gentle for everyday use. I debated between the anua and the some by mi miracle toner but got anua as it seemed less harsh.

as for the black/whiteheads on my nose I think the oil cleanser should help with that hopefully.

1703992633.0,Where To Buy Skincare (Price Comparison),"So I‚Äôve recently gotten into Korean skin care and one thing I‚Äôve noticed is the lack of availability in the states. Obviously this isn‚Äôt completely shocking, considering Korea is over six thousand miles away. Still in our modern world it is so hard to find legit sellers for these products in a time where anyone can sell anything online.

I live in a fairly big city, so I have had the luxury of getting my items in person up until this point. But this solution still has its faults, most notably: lack of selection and overpricing products. (For overpricing the example I give is the Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum which on average sells for around 8 dollars across the board was priced at 20 dollars). 

The only other option left is shopping online. I have spent a while looking for reputable stores where I wouldn‚Äôt accidentally end up with a counterfeit (Amazon). The places I have found are: Oliveyoung, yesstyle, stylevana, and jolse. 

I wanted to compare these stores and settled on yesstyle and stylevana mostly due to oliveyoung‚Äôs lack of variety and constant supply issues, and no jolse because I‚Äôm a bit lazy.

I have exactly 18 products in my cart, all the exact same products. I also applied easily found codes for each site, the price comparison above.

Both of these websites can be known for their delays in shipping. Yesstyle has an estimate of January 14th, while Stylevana gives no estimate. I will note that for both carts 17 ideas listed that they ship in 1 to 2 days. While yesstyle had one product that ships in 7 to 14 days, and stylevana has one product that ships in 14 to 21 days.

For transparency sake I have shopped with yesstyle before and never had a problems with their shipping. But if you have shopped from either or both stores let me know your experience below. I‚Äôd like to know how you guys are feeling in terms of pricing and shipping.

I feel like i also have to mention aside from avoiding sunscreen for basically 14 years depleting my collagen and elastin quicker  i grew up in a mentally neglecting household and parents who argued with each other and me and my siblings and we couldn‚Äôt see eye to eye for a very long time which led to me growing up extremely emotionally drained and stressed and crying a lot of the time and years of stress probably affected my skins condition and collagen production and in the last 2 years or so i‚Äôve had clinical depression which i m trying my best t manage and i get help but that had made me look so drained and my skin shows it too and lastly i was a competitive club swimmer and my skin was always exposed to chlorine and I didn‚Äôt use any skin care back then i‚Äôm not comfortable posting photos but if i have to to determine if i can get laser resurfacing or microneedling i‚Äôll consider it.  any help is appreciated pls :(

Old routine that I was doing for a few months (bc I was broke and couldn‚Äôt afford my old products)/

I‚Äôve always used CeraVe foaming facial cleanser to wash off makeup or just wash my face in the morning and night. Never given me an issue. 

I‚Äôve been using Peach Slices Snail Rescue Blemish busting toner for awhile too and haven‚Äôt had an issue with it. 

And lastly I‚Äôd just put CeraVe moisturizing cream.

Recently I started using soonjung 2x barrier cream again, and started using (for the first time) beauty of Josean revive eye serum, and I‚Äôm from rice toner. 

So my routine right now is:

1. Wash my face in the am with cerave cleanser, rice toner, wait for it to dry.

2. beauty of josean eye cream, wait for it to dry, 

3. then the peach slices snail rescue, wait for it to dry, 

4. and end with the soonjung 2x cream.

 Sometimes I also add a layer of cerave cream on top after the 2x barrier cream but I haven‚Äôt done that in a bit

I wash my face and do the routine in the am, and before bed as well. So I do this 2x a day, and at night I put frownies on after too. 

Am I doing something wrong? 

I‚Äôve used the 2x barrier cream before and it never gave me issues. I used the peach slices snail rescue before without any issue. The only two really new products I‚Äôve incorporated is the eye serum and rice toner but I‚Äôm only flaky around my mouth. Could it be the toner? Or the snail rescue? Is 2x a day too much? Help!!

The last thing I decided to grab was some cotton pads since I ran out of pre soaked ones. I will be using those to refill my anua toner pads by soaking them in the heartleaf toner.

1712691528.0,Why my skin seems to play with me ? TT,"
Hi everyone, I‚Äôm kinda big noob in the skincare game and I‚Äôll explain my strange post title. 

I‚Äôm f21 and as of now, I don‚Äôt had many skin problems, appart a bit acne on teenage years, far from being annoyed by. And since I‚Äôm 18-19, I‚Äôm pretty much done with that without any treatment or specious skin care routine. 
Theses last weeks, I would like to have a better skin routine and I‚Äôve passed some hours to get know more about it. I‚Äôve bought 2 serums for ¬´¬†normal skin¬†¬ª, with good appreciations, good ingredients for doing the best and have a great glass skin like I see on social media (in a big part on TikTok or Pinterest if I‚Äôm totally honest, but with some cheaper products possibly üòÄ). It‚Äôs been one week I actually mix them with my own moisturiser cream and sunscreen two times a day, morning and night after cleaning my face but i don‚Äôt see any noticeable difference, in better or in worse. it‚Äôs weird, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just coincidence that‚Äôs my skin become a little bit textured by zone, or if I touched my face without very cleaned hands and so my skin react to ? Or if serums are juste bad for me and my skin.?. :/ 

I should say, I‚Äôm not really patient and If it would have noticeable good difference, when it comes, after how long does it have an effect? 

That‚Äôs the point ! ^^ someone who can enlighten me on this subject?

1712530176.0,Thoughts on the COSRX Peptide Booster serum ?,"Hi I was curious if other people tried the COSRX peptide booster serum ?

So far I am using it as a ""pre toner"" product, as I often wash my face and don't put my skin care products immediatly after, especially in the morning, I would rinse my face, prepare my coffee and once it gets ready I would do my skincare routine. So I would use that peptide booster right after rinsing my face so it doesn't get too dry and so far my skin seem to love it. Most of the products I use are oriented towards hydratation and glow finish so I can't say if it did a difference but my skin seem to like this product well.

My skin type is combo, in summer it's more oily, in winter it tends to be more dry/dehydrated. I have been getting a lot of compliments on my skin recently, I don't think it is only due to it but I do think it helped to the overall look of my skin.

My routine is currently:

AM:

* rinse my face with water
* COSRX Peptide booster serum (then I usually do something else as my skin hates when I apply my products too quickly)
* Laneige Cerapeptide Toner or  Glow Recipe Cloud Berry Essence (depends on my mood)
* Serum Goodal Vita C
* Face cream Mary & May (if my skin is dryer I would use the black tube with Idebanone, if I feel my skin is plump enough with hydration I would use the green tube that is more of a gel (followed by spf if I go out)

PM:

* Belif face wash ( or I would double wash if I have lots of makeup/spf on)
* COSRX Peptide booster Serum
* Laneige Cerapeptide Toner or I'm From Fig Essence or Mary & May Black Berry Essence
* Serum Erborian Ginseng
* Face Cream Mary & May Idebanone ( sometimes I switch to one of the moisturizer from Belif)
* if needed I would add a night oil from Erborian, their ""Skin Therapy"" oil, but I rarely need it.

I have also changed moisturizers quite a few times now because the ones I tend to like keep getting discontinued üò≠ I can‚Äôt remember the other ones I‚Äôve used before but the last one I was using was the Dr. Belmeur Cica Emulsion that I would get from the faceshop that closed down.

I went to the H-Mart near me but a lot of them are out of stock so I picked this one up because it felt great when I tested it out. It wasn‚Äôt sticky or thick (which is what I prefer). Now, they did mark it as ‚Äúnew‚Äù so I‚Äôm assuming that they‚Äôve only started carrying it. I‚Äôve never heard of this brand and it‚Äôs actually quite cheaper than the dr. Belmeur so I got curious and googled it but I CAN‚ÄôT FIND IT being sold online in north america and even in what looked like asian websites they were only selling a few products from this brand but not specifically this lotion. Another thing is that the label on the bottle was CLEARLY applied by hand because it‚Äôs crooked and there were air bubbles underneath. There was a website for the company in the packaging so I checked it out but the ingredients were suspicious. Like, what is pharmacomal extract and how come it makes up 80% of this product? I looked it up and nothing that relates to skincare comes up in the searches. Also, why is the word ‚ÄúVonate‚Äù on the ingredients list repeatedly at the bottom?? I also looked it up and it‚Äôs not even a word???

She has very sensitive skin, and because of that she‚Äôs prone to breaking out when products don‚Äôt work for her. She tends to have normal to dry skin, but like I mentioned before it‚Äôs been really dry these past few months.

She has a bit of sun damage, not very obvious but it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs only started using sunscreen for about 4 years. It‚Äôs a bit hard to find a sunscreen that doesn‚Äôt leave a horrible white cast- we‚Äôre latinas, she‚Äôs a bit lighter but CerVe sunscreen still leaves a horrible white cast which is why she uses the tint version.

1712073640.0,2 things to consider when choosing a dermatology in Korea,"I‚Äôm a local Korean 
Went to over 20 different clinics probably closer to 40 (consultations and medications included) to treat acne, acne scars, pigments, enlarged pores. I probably had procedures done at about 10 different clinics. 

I would like to share a bit of my personal experience after spending thousands of dollars  on so many different clinics to treat my acne prone skin and pigments. But keep in mind that this is just from my personal experience, but also‚Ä¶ these are just really basic things all Korean locals would consider before choosing a dermatology but I noticed that most foreigners don‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ 

1. Make sure the dermatology has board certified dermatologists
 - This is probably the most basic & important thing to consider because getting your skin treated at a ‚Äúdermatology‚Äù without board certified dermatologists is just like getting plastic surgery from a family physician or a doctor who isn‚Äôt a specialist in plastic surgery or going to a gynecology run by a non board certified dermatologist.
- I realized this after seeing less improvements, getting deeper scarring and receiving risky acne prescriptions from NON board certified dermatologies

2. Check the kind of laser machine they have (this is the SECOND most important thing not the first)
You need to make sure that the dermatology machines are being used by someone who specializes in dermatology!!!

1711800280.0,I don't understand my skin anymore,"Hi, 22(f) here. I've used some skincare off and on before, but this time I really wanted to commit to it and take care of my skin a little better.

Without skincare I'd say I have combination skin, where my T-zone can be really dehydrated and flaky, but also greasy at the same time. My chin and jawline gets greasy easily as well and my cheeks can be just dry.

Well, I started a new skincare routine and at first my skin seemed so clear an moisturised. Before I started using some Korean skincare products I used two cleansers from cerave (the foaming cleanser and the oil water based cleanser) and my skinbarrier became really sensitive and irritated. Now I was already aware of my sensitive skin since some skincare I used before this could burn my skin as well. 

After this I thought my skin barrier was probably damaged and ordered some Korean skincare to hopefully fix it. Like I said, at first my skin became very clear and hydrated but after a while I started breaking out and noticing my T-zone getting VERY oily during the day. Unfortunately I haven't really been able to rule out what caused this; whether it was a certain product or just hormones or something. I stopped using my sunscreen a while (the boj one) but that didn't help. Then I stopped using my cerave foaming cleanser all at once and I thought it helped at first but it didn't.  

The skincare I use right now is:

AM
-roundlap moisturising cleanser (just bought that yesterday tho)
-purito panthenol rebarrier cream with low ph
-Beauty of Joseon sunscreen with rice prebiotics

PM
-Haruharu wonder oil cleanser
-Roundlap moisturising cleanser (just bought that yesterday tho)
-purito panthenol rebarrier cream with low ph

I'm a little afraid of using acids yet since I feel like I still have to restore my barrier.

My question is: any idea how I can solve my oily (mostly) nose and breakouts? Any idea which product it could be? 

(I thought it could be a sensitivity for niancenamide as well since it is in the moisturiser and the cerave cleanser I don't use anymore, since I've reacted to it before when I used the the ordinary niancenamide serum)

Any help will be greatly appreciated!!",koreanskincare

i went to a doctor: i live in dhaka where everyone is money opportunistic, people get ripped off easily i went to a dermatologist for the first time, i told her all my problems, then she prescribed some skincare products and recommended me to get a 4500tk treatment. which shocked me and i felt like the doc was trying to earn money then treating me. i just didn't say anything and left. (u might say 45 usd is less but in dhaka its a lot)  
this are the products recommended by the doctor: acne bye soap, facid bt fugidal cream, safi blue moisture and the 4500tk treatment.

morning routine: i use saliclic acid neutrogena face wash with garnier meceller water, then i apply benzoyl peroxide and sometimes layer with ordinary niancinamide 10% with zinc. then end it with revolution skincare Thirsty Mood Quenching Moisture Gel if i am going out i apply benton mineral sunscreen  
night routine: i use saliclic acid neutrogena face wash with garnier meceller water, then i apply benzoyl peroxide and sometimes layer with ordinary niancinamide 10% with zinc. i sometimes apply ordinary retinol 1% with squalane, then end it with revolution skincare Thirsty Mood Quenching Moisture Gel

1711709596.0,[Review] Mania Holic Sunscreen Pack 50+ PA+++,"I bought this Korean sunscreen (made in Seoul) at Bologna Cosmoprof. I think this is my holy grail: it feels like I applied nothing on skin (and I have a very oily skin), plus it helps keeping sebum production under control: even after hours my face is not shiny or greasy at all.

Even reapplication is super simple, since the sunscreen does not pill and does not get sticky.

The producer claims something about hydrocolloidal films and some (bullshit?) like that. I don't know how much this is true, but the feeling is amazing, my skin is super smooth.

My concern is on its efficacy and safety: it'a new product, with no review at all, so I wonder if UVA/UVB protection is actually that good or not (remember Purito?).

Anyway, here's the link to producer website: [https://firstmarket2.cafe24.com/shop3/m/product/sunscrren-pack/141/category/116/display/1/](https://firstmarket2.cafe24.com/shop3/m/product/sunscrren-pack/141/category/116/display/1/)

1711369372.0,Cleansing balms ,"Hi everyone! I've been eyeing on cleasing balms lately and right now, I have my eyes on Beauty of Joseon Radiance Balm and the COSRX pure fit cica balm. This is actually the first time I'll ever buy and use one, so I wanted to know your thoughts about these products. I'd also like to take this time to ask a few questions regarding cleansing balms in general.

1. Do you have to cleanse your face again with a facial wash after using cleansing balms? Also, which comes first? Balms or facial wash?
2. I've heard that these are used as a makeup remover. Does it only remove makeup? or can it also remove sunscreen and face creams (??? sorry, i really don't know)
3. Are balms better than oils?
4. How often should you use these?

That's all, thank you!",koreanskincare

1710788975.0,Damaged skin barrier? Recommendations,"For the past couple of months I have noticed a quite drastic difference in my skin. I have had peeling, especially on my cheekbones. However, the biggest problem is the breakouts of blackheads and closed comedones all over my forehead. Also, all of my skincare has started to burn. The only way I can tolerate putting anything on my face without burning is by first applying organic aloe vera gel. 

As far as my current routine, I tend to rotate products based on what I think I need. For cleanser I have been using the la roche posay purifying foaming cleanser or the cosrx snail mucin one. For moisturizer I also use the cosrx snail mucin one or one of the la roche posay ones. However I noticed the most burning with those so I went back to the cerave moisturizing cream which seems to work a bit better. I sometimes use salycilic acid on my forehead because I thought it might help with the breakouts but I don‚Äôt necessarily see that it is making a difference and I fear it might be too drying? I‚Äôm also a big fan of pimple patches since I tend to be a picker as well (bad, I know). 

I saw a video on tiktok that made me think that the cause of these issues may be a damaged skin barrier? Maybe the winter weather dried my face out too badly and I didn‚Äôt realize it?

1710439507.0,How often do you switch your skincare products ?,"**For people who have more than the minimum of products, how often do you rotate/ switch between two products ? (skin type: combination, not sensitive)**

I love getting new products but I obviously can't use them all at the same time, I try to keep my routine with toner/essence + serum + moisturizer (aside from face wash and spf if i go out).

I have mostly a lot of choices in my toners/essences, but I often find myself unsure how to rotate them, so far I tried to use the same ones and whenever I feel like it I would switch to another one, while keeping the ones for day and night.

**Those are the 7 toners/essences I have for example:**

\- I'm From Fig Boosting Essence ( I use it at night especially in winter)

\- Laneige Cerapeptide Mist ( I use it in the morning or through the day if my skin need a boost)

\-  Sollala Multi Vitamin Refresh Toner ( it's a brightening product so I think to keep it for the morning)

\- Epona Birch Juice Premium (I haven't tried it enough to have an idea)

\- COSRX 6 Peptide Boosting Serum (it says serum but also to use it as a 1st step so I use it in my toner/essence stage, I use it sometimes in the day or at night since I have more time)

\- Mary & May Black Berry Complex Cream Essence ( I haven't tried it long enough)

\- Glow Recipe Cloud Berry Bright ( I haven't tried it long enough either)

**How would you rotate those ? Should I just select one for day and another for night and just change whenever I feel like it, or should I try to stick to the same ones for a month or so to have some results ? (ps: my skin is quite good for the moment, I don't have any major issues I am expecting huge change, it's more for maintenance, aside from some pimples sometimes but nothing too bad).**",koreanskincare

Heard raving reviews, stylevana had a buy 2 get 1 free promotion event. It was too good to not buy!

I had known it had protease and sugarcane but everyone kept saying the exfoliation was super gentle and okay for daily use. I thought my sensitive skin (who HATES Salicylic acid) would be able to handle it (it can handle retinoid and Vit C just fine)

But now I‚Äôve tried it on for the first time and my face tingled as if I added retinoids on. 
To be safe, I left out any other actives usually in my routine. My face still feels tingly, is this normal or is my skin just having a bad day? (Sometimes my face tingles and is more sensitive for no reason, even when I‚Äôve used no active at all)

Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Pads - So far these have been amazing!! I have been using them as mini sheet masks and the hydration is unreal, I highly recommend.

Round Lab Birch Juice Sunscreen - (repurchase) I love this sunscreen, its like a second moisturizer. My dry skin loves it. My favorite sunscreen so far and I have tried quite a few.

Amplen Ceramide Shot Ampoule - Haven't tried this yet, testing it out on my hand it is a bit sticky but definitely very hydrating 

Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum - Been using this for a few days now, its great! But I think the round lab is still my favorite.

ILLIYOON Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream- (repurchase) This is very heavy and great to seal everything in, but I actually don't consider it to be very hydrating, just good at sealing in moisture from other products

MEDI-PEEL Extra Super 9+ 2.0 - Haven't tried this yet, but i cannot wait to!

Olive Young Care Plus Spot Cover Spot Patch-- 102 patches!! Cant pass that up, plus I have heard great things

BIODANCE Hydro Cera-Nol Real Deep Mask Sheet-- My influenced purchase, I love anything with extreme hydration!

acropass Trouble Cure - Haven't tried these yet but I love microdart patches for deep pimples and wanted to try a new brand, these come with a cleansing step!",koreanskincare

1709940802.0,Please critique and help improve my skin routine!! ,"Hello! I'd really appreciate any recommendations for my skincare. I'll be travelling to the uk soon and can get more things not available in my country so doing my best to have a list.

I currently use a local salicylic acid facewash, nuetrogena hydro boost water gel, skinaqua sunscreen and a 0.5% adaplene gel given by a derm at night. Sometimes I use the pixi vitamin c toner.

I have comedonal acne, oily, textured skin but it dries out a bit where I use the gel. I am south asian and have some pigmentation as well as spots from acne. Currently I get acne very less as compared to before a derm gave me the above routine but I randomly get white pimples and I've never had completely clear skin.

I am currently thinking:
-Add oil cleanse step with the Klairs Gentle Black Fresh cleansing oil
-Same local facewash of salicylic acid (please lmk if there's a suggestion)
-Add a toner (I am confused with which one and should I focus on hydration or exfoliation, I am currently leaning towards a hydrating one but I have no idea which.)
-Use the mixsoon bean essence
-Use Axis Y Dark Spot Correcting Glow Serum
-Same moisturiser (or if i should use smth else)

I've also heard great things about the Cocokind chlorophyll discoloration serum. I've also seen people use Anua heartleat toner pads with the jelly and exfoliation side for hyperpigmentation.

I would really appreciate any suggestions for an AM/PM routine. I've gotten bits and pieces from South Asian skincare creators online but ofc not one thing fits all. But I'd appreciate any guidance either way. 

Thankyou so much. I really want to clear up my skin in my 20s, it's been years of struggles.

1709686527.0,Review of Illyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream,"I never ever write reviews but I feel like this product deserves a huge shoutout.

I‚Äôve always had combination oily skin.  But now that I‚Äôm in my mid 40s my skin has just become all over dry.  However, I have never ever had any sensitivity to any products regardless of ingredients or scents. But I must have finally come in contact with the one product that my skin does not love, although I have still not figured out what exactly it is. My under eyes and eyelids all of a sudden became extremely red, dry, inflamed and burned with every product I applied.  Since I don‚Äôt know what caused it I decided to cut out all actives and just go back to the basics.  I did a ton of research and decided to try the Avene eye contour cream to help and hopefully heal my irritation.  While I did notice VERY minimal improvement each day that passed while using the Avene eye cream, the improvement was extremely slow and not doing what I had hoped it would do.  

So I went back to doing more research and decided to purchase the Illyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream, and all I have to say is HOLY COW.  I used it the very first night I received it on my face,including my under eyes and eyelids, and when I woke up the very next morning, ALL irritation was 100% gone.  No redness, no burning, no inflammation, no itching!  It had all disappeared overnight like magic. Plus the moisture this provided was just incredible. Like I said, my skin became dry as I got older and I finally found my cure.  This product will forever be in my skincare line up.  I cannot recommend this product enough.  

I know everyone‚Äôs skin is different and may not react the same way as someone else‚Äôs but I write this in hopes of helping someone who may be going through the struggles I did, this product is worth a shot.  For me it was a miracle in a bottle.  ",koreanskincare

after almost one month of using most of the items i'm doing a review cause why not (there will be lots of beauty of joseon productscause the first time i got into korean skincare it was the first brand that popped up on my feed. I am now aware of all the other brands lol)
 
I have normal to dry skin with a slightly oiler t-zone. Unfortunately despite all the skincare i have lots of tiny bumps and red spots on my face. i recently ordered the isntree BHA 2% essence to try some exfoliation, i'll let you know how it is when the package arrives. 

CLEANSERS 
Boj ginseng cleaning oil: i like the fact that it doesn't have a smell and doesn't leave a film. It leaves my skin quite clean, but it cannot get rid of my sebaceous filaments, so i'll try another oil cleanser next time. Takes a whooooole lot to use the whole bottle, like 3 months. Overall it's pretty meh.

Boj green plum cleanser: this one is nice, really gentle, makes my skin clean and doesn't strip. But i think next time i'll buy the round lab dokdo cleanser cause i heard so many good reviews about it and i love that brand. 


TONER 
i'm from rice toner: it does everything a toner should do: hyrdates your skin, and gives a nice glow. A bit pricey tho :/ but that's fine. 

SERUM 
Boj glow serum: it makes my skin glowing (ig it really lives up to his name lol) and that's it. After 3 weeks use along with the toner i definitely noticed a glowier skin tho. 

MOISTURISER
Boj dynasty cream: mmmh i'm not sure about this one. Sometimes it leaves my skin a bit tight, and i'm afraid this product might be the cause of the many bumps and smalll pimples i have on my skin, they appeared a few days ago and i've used the cream for more than one month. I recently ordered the round lab birch juice moisturiser, i'll update you about it 

SUNSCREEN 
Roundlab birch juice moisturising sunscreen: if perfection would be embodied in a sunscreen, it would be the birch juice moisturising sunscreen. Literally perfect, flawless. Hydrates my skin, doesn't leave a white cast, and makes my skin so smooth. Some people even complimented my skin because of this sunscreen's effect, it felt awesome. 

MASK
Boj red bean pore mask: it feels like it doesn't do anything to my skin. really. i think my skin prefers clay masks. 

I hope this helps! Let me know your opinions and concerns! I'd love to hear some recommendations from you guys! have a great day and clear skin <3",koreanskincare

I really love toners and essences, I think they are my favorite step of my skincare. I recently ordered a skincare box and ended up with a couple more essences. So now I am a bit unsure how to maybe rotate them, so far I just used whatever I felt like using that day as they have similar actions. It's not in the picture but I also have the Belif toner, Laneige Cerapeptide (my favorite with the Fig Essence of I'm From) and the Multi Vitamin Toner from Sollalla.

**I have combination skin, not sensitive but reactive sometimes if I am very stressed/apply my products without letting them fully sink in or if the tab water is too hard**.

So far my routine used to be, regarding the toner/Essences step, to use in the morning Laneige Cerapeptide and in the evening the Fig Essence.

I finished my Laneige toner so in the morning I kind of switched every day what I used. But I am trying to use this week for example in the morning the Mugwort Essence (and still the Fig Essence at night).

They all have anti aging/hydrating/pore care/ brightening... properties.

How do you suggest I could rotate my products ?

I was thinking maybe to have period when I could use **I'm From Fig Essence+ Mugwort Essence**, and another time to use instead the **Epona Premium Birch Juice + COSRX 6 Peptide Booster**",koreanskincare

1. Mediheal Phyto Enzyme - Mainly endorsed for textured skin; scented so I‚Äôm not sure about this since I prefer non-fragrant products

2. Needly Daily Toner Pads - One of the top mentioned for textured skin and is also said to reduce redness and irritation

3. Anua Heartleaf Toner Pads - Also one of the top mentioned pads for textured skin but I‚Äôve seen a few reviews here and there that this broke their skin out üò¢ 

4. Numbuzin Vitamin-Niacinamide Concentrated Pad - Has Vitamin C so mostly targets hyperpigmentation but is also said to help skin barrier

My current routine has been: 

Cerave acne cleanser in the morning 

Cerave Hydrating Toner in the Morning. 

Cerave Vitamin E serum 

Followed by Cerave moisturizer with SPF....I was going through a kick idk. 

In the evening I use 

Cerave hydrating foaming cleanser which I would say does a decent job of cleaning makeup off my face but I feel like it could do better. 

Same toner from the morning. 

Cerave Retinol 

Cerave nightcream with peptides.   
In addition to those microcomedones being a concern I do have pretty large pores, I'm trying to be mindful of fine lines as I get older (I'm only 31 but ya know) and I do work outside since I am a Park Ranger, so a good moisturizer with SPF is a must, I am pretty fair skinned so I do burn easily.

1709043317.0,Do you find that some mist (Mugwort essence I'm from for instance) go terribly in a mist ??,"I'm planning a travel soon and I often have kind of allergies in that place so while at home my skin is not sensitive, once I'm there I feel my skin react a lot more to certain products. For example I love using the I'm From Fig Essence at my night routine (I have combination skin) but whenever I go to that place my skin hate it and I would get red itchy areas on my face). I then have to wash my face, use a micellar water to rinse the tab water and then sprit some of my favorite mist from Caudalie.

I noticed however that my skin react less in products in a mist (as I don't have to rub them in my skin).

So I know I will 100% bring my Laneige Cerapeptide toner in a mist HOWEVER I wanted to try if my skin could agree with I'm From Mugwort Essence, but I don't know if it is because it is thicker than the Laneige one, but in the same type of mist bottle, the product just come so aggressively ,I feel the bottle just spit on my face instead of having a nice fine mist. Which in the end I still have to spray the product with my hands.

1689336781.0,My skin transformation (so far),"Thought I might share my skincare routine and find out if anyone wants to impart any of their wisdom on me. I'm still pretty new to K-beauty and skincare products.

My 'before' wasn't too bad but I was constantly breaking out and makeup wouldn't even cover my blemishes. Now I don't wear anything to cover my skin - only wearing eyeliner when I feel like it.

I wash my face with a very gentle bar soap with vitamin A and E and activated charcoal in it. My skin is very sensitive and it doesn't break out with the use of this as a cleanser so plz no hate <3

I follow with Cosrx AHA/BHA toner and then Cosrx Snail Mucin 96%. If I go outside then I also apply Illiyoon ceramide ato soothing gel (I opt for the gel since creams tend to be too heavy for my skin and cause breakouts). 

Every 2-3 nights I have been using SOMEBYMI Intense retinol reactivating serum on my T-zone instead of the snail mucin, and I apply the ceramide ato soothing gel like eye-cream each night.

I find it really hard to follow extensive skincare routines but if anyone thinks I should be doing more then I'd love to hear your feedback.

1709585299.0,skincare review :D,"hii

after almost one month of using most of the items i'm doing a review cause why not (there will be lots of beauty of joseon productscause the first time i got into korean skincare it was the first brand that popped up on my feed. I am now aware of all the other brands lol)
 
I have normal to dry skin with a slightly oiler t-zone. Unfortunately despite all the skincare i have lots of tiny bumps and red spots on my face. i recently ordered the isntree BHA 2% essence to try some exfoliation, i'll let you know how it is when the package arrives. 

CLEANSERS 
Boj ginseng cleaning oil: i like the fact that it doesn't have a smell and doesn't leave a film. It leaves my skin quite clean, but it cannot get rid of my sebaceous filaments, so i'll try another oil cleanser next time. Takes a whooooole lot to use the whole bottle, like 3 months. Overall it's pretty meh.

Boj green plum cleanser: this one is nice, really gentle, makes my skin clean and doesn't strip. But i think next time i'll buy the round lab dokdo cleanser cause i heard so many good reviews about it and i love that brand. 


TONER 
i'm from rice toner: it does everything a toner should do: hyrdates your skin, and gives a nice glow. A bit pricey tho :/ but that's fine. 

SERUM 
Boj glow serum: it makes my skin glowing (ig it really lives up to his name lol) and that's it. After 3 weeks use along with the toner i definitely noticed a glowier skin tho. 

MOISTURISER
Boj dynasty cream: mmmh i'm not sure about this one. Sometimes it leaves my skin a bit tight, and i'm afraid this product might be the cause of the many bumps and smalll pimples i have on my skin, they appeared a few days ago and i've used the cream for more than one month. I recently ordered the round lab birch juice moisturiser, i'll update you about it 

SUNSCREEN 
Roundlab birch juice moisturising sunscreen: if perfection would be embodied in a sunscreen, it would be the birch juice moisturising sunscreen. Literally perfect, flawless. Hydrates my skin, doesn't leave a white cast, and makes my skin so smooth. Some people even complimented my skin because of this sunscreen's effect, it felt awesome. 

MASK
Boj red bean pore mask: it feels like it doesn't do anything to my skin. really. i think my skin prefers clay masks. 

I hope this helps! Let me know your opinions and concerns! I'd love to hear some recommendations from you guys! have a great day and clear skin <3",koreanskincare

1712073640.0,2 things to consider when choosing a dermatology in Korea,"I‚Äôm a local Korean 
Went to over 20 different clinics probably closer to 40 (consultations and medications included) to treat acne, acne scars, pigments, enlarged pores. I probably had procedures done at about 10 different clinics. 

I would like to share a bit of my personal experience after spending thousands of dollars  on so many different clinics to treat my acne prone skin and pigments. But keep in mind that this is just from my personal experience, but also‚Ä¶ these are just really basic things all Korean locals would consider before choosing a dermatology but I noticed that most foreigners don‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ 

1. Make sure the dermatology has board certified dermatologists
 - This is probably the most basic & important thing to consider because getting your skin treated at a ‚Äúdermatology‚Äù without board certified dermatologists is just like getting plastic surgery from a family physician or a doctor who isn‚Äôt a specialist in plastic surgery or going to a gynecology run by a non board certified dermatologist.
- I realized this after seeing less improvements, getting deeper scarring and receiving risky acne prescriptions from NON board certified dermatologies

2. Check the kind of laser machine they have (this is the SECOND most important thing not the first)
You need to make sure that the dermatology machines are being used by someone who specializes in dermatology!!!

Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Pads - So far these have been amazing!! I have been using them as mini sheet masks and the hydration is unreal, I highly recommend.

Round Lab Birch Juice Sunscreen - (repurchase) I love this sunscreen, its like a second moisturizer. My dry skin loves it. My favorite sunscreen so far and I have tried quite a few.

Amplen Ceramide Shot Ampoule - Haven't tried this yet, testing it out on my hand it is a bit sticky but definitely very hydrating

ILLIYOON Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream- (repurchase) This is very heavy and great to seal everything in, but I actually don't consider it to be very hydrating, just good at sealing in moisture from other products

MEDI-PEEL Extra Super 9+ 2.0 - Haven't tried this yet, but i cannot wait to!

She has very sensitive skin, and because of that she‚Äôs prone to breaking out when products don‚Äôt work for her. She tends to have normal to dry skin, but like I mentioned before it‚Äôs been really dry these past few months.

She has a bit of sun damage, not very obvious but it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs only started using sunscreen for about 4 years. It‚Äôs a bit hard to find a sunscreen that doesn‚Äôt leave a horrible white cast- we‚Äôre latinas, she‚Äôs a bit lighter but CerVe sunscreen still leaves a horrible white cast which is why she uses the tint version.

1704917651.0,My Lamiche Experience,"I visited Seoul 2 weeks ago and visited Lamiche clinic while there. I wanted to share my experiences and also open up the chance for yall to ask questions :)

I found Lamiche through social media searching for skincare clinics. They seemed to have a very good reputation and I found many Tiktoks/Insta reels by foreigners. I do speak Korean but my husband does not so I was interested in places that worked with foreigners quite frequently.

**PRE-VISIT!** I initially contacted Lamiche via Kakao Talk. I always do this because I know places often charge foreigners different prices, and I felt the a bit iffy about not finding any prices in English. Once they realized I was not Korean, I was shuttled over to their foreigner account and was provided their package pricing. I didn't think anything of the package model at first, however I realized during the sales consultation at the clinic how ridiculous it is. More on that later. I did like that they were receptive about my concerns regarding laser treatments and my skin color, and they asked for photos of my face before confirming in advance that I could receive laser treatments.

**DOCTOR'S CONSULTATION!** The visit started out well. They did skin imaging after which I met with the sales rep/translator who did a basic intro of skin health and acne. The doctor came in for maybe 5 minutes and just explained areas that we would benefit from treatment.

**SALES CONSULTATION!** We were called into an office with the sales rep/translator and presented charts with what the doctor recommended. I forgot my tax bracket and accepted everything the doctor recommended. In total I spent 5k won. I was offered a discount (sorry I don't remember how much) in exchange for posting on social media which I accepted (this is my post - sorry Lamiche). They also came back a third time and offered me botox and threads for free which I refused and honestly found very weird because I was very clear at the beginning that I did not want those at all.

Back to the  pricing, Lamiche has package options for foreigners (pricing for Koreans is different). One laser was about 300k won, the the price of the individual laser went down the more lasers/treatments you purchased. For example, purchasing 8 lasers led to an individual price of about 100k won. However, charging 300k won for one laser without knowing individual pricing means they can charge you 300k for a laser that is worth less than what you are paying. My husband only wanted one or two laser so I was frantically googling what would be the best bang for his buck. They did not provide a pricing list for individual lasers/injections.

That being said, definitely hem and haw. At the end of the day, it's sales and they are willing to a little give and take. I wish I asked for them to do more neck treatments.

**AFTERCARE INSTRUCTIONS!** Once consultation and payment was done, I was given a verbal list of aftercare instructions. Most of it I don't remember tbh and I had to keep texting them in the following weeks to ask if this or that was ok. I remember they said no actives for 2 months, but when I texted, they said one month. I think it would be really helpful for the clinic to provide written aftercare instructions. But for now, it would be good to go ready to take some notes.

**PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS!** My husband and I were both prescribed medications that would could fill across the street. We were prescribed some antibiotics, melanin inhibitors, etc. The sales consultant/translator asked if we were taking any medications and I mentioned broadly some medications I took (think saying antibiotics instead of saying doxycycline). He said ""oh thats fine"" and I was like ok great. However, after getting home, I realized like wait, he's not a doctor and he didn't even ask about my specific medications. My medication is prone to interactions so I tried to find interactions online but I could not find the medications they prescribed.  So I texted the clinic and asked again. After checking with the doctor, the doctor said ""check with your US doctor to make sure you can take the medications since they prescribed your medication"". SIR??? YOU PRESCRIBED THESE TO ME! The doctor should have absolutely checked what medication I was taking in detail before even writing a prescription. This feels like medical malpractice issue ready to happen. I ended up not taking the medications because it was Christmas holiday and I could not get in touch with my US doctor.

**TREATMENT!** Then I was sent down to the the treatment floor. The treatment process was insane. First off, don't let anyone lie to you, that shit HURTS. My husband heard people screaming (the staff said it was common) and he cancelled some procedures half way through his treatment. The doctor wanted me to take a numbing injection in my butt because I was going to have so many procedures but I really didn't want that so they topically numbed my face with cream twice and injections 2-3 times. In retrospect, I am glad I refused the butt shot because again, they did not check any of my medical history to make sure that would be safe for me. Even with all the numbing it hurt although I found most tolerable. The Ulthera laser was the absolute worst, and I was getting treatments from roughly 5pm to 11pm. They did give me a really nice vibrating spikey ball to help distract me from the pain. They did come to me mid procedure (pre-Ulthera hell) and offered me a discount on something on my neck and I was like fuck it, let's do it. But the staff were great, especially once they found out I could speak Korean. The male doctor doing most of the procedures chatted with me (as much as I could manage) and the nurses were lovely too. There was also a female translator who stuck around until 11pm when my treatment was done and she was lovely! Shout out to her. I hope she got paid overtime.

**POST TREATMENT!** After bandaging up my injection points, I was ready to go home. Personally, I feel like you pay 5k and are at the clinic until 11pm, I think they should at least call you a cab but that just me. We left and grabbed fried chicken nearby in a place that was popping, before heading home after hailing a cab. Under my chin was definitely very sore as they said but otherwise I felt fine. I had some skin tenderness so I couldn't not use pressure when washing my face but that went away after about 3 days.  I'll be honest - with all the crazy stuff they did to my skin, I am still in awe that I did not get/need painkillers to take home. That being said my skin was SO dry and the products they gave were not at all hydrating enough. I ended up doing an Olive Young run to buy products because my skin was so so dry. 2 weeks out, I still have some numbness under my chin but otherwise feel totally fine. My husband came out with some crazy skin bruising under his chin (he said they were making a v-line) but I can't speak much for that since I wasn't there for his treatment.

**RESULTS!** That being said, their lasers/procedures definitely work. My skin is so much clearer and smoother, but I do not see much brightening. That being said, I didn't expected not to get blackheads two weeks after the service but maybe that was  just poor knowledge on my part. In any case, double cleansing cleans them away so so easily now, although my pores are the ""same size"" (no change in appearance).  The fat reduction treatments have me a bit skeptical as I do not see any changes yet and under my chin is still pretty numb. My husband's skin is so clear and however his redness has just started returning the past few days. Overall very happy at this point.

**TLDR;** However, the procedures are incredibly painful but the results speak for themselves. I will be getting procedures done again my next visit to Seoul but at a different clinic with more transparent pricing.

1711800280.0,I don't understand my skin anymore,"Hi, 22(f) here. I've used some skincare off and on before, but this time I really wanted to commit to it and take care of my skin a little better.

Without skincare I'd say I have combination skin, where my T-zone can be really dehydrated and flaky, but also greasy at the same time. My chin and jawline gets greasy easily as well and my cheeks can be just dry.

Well, I started a new skincare routine and at first my skin seemed so clear an moisturised. Before I started using some Korean skincare products I used two cleansers from cerave (the foaming cleanser and the oil water based cleanser) and my skinbarrier became really sensitive and irritated. Now I was already aware of my sensitive skin since some skincare I used before this could burn my skin as well. 

After this I thought my skin barrier was probably damaged and ordered some Korean skincare to hopefully fix it. Like I said, at first my skin became very clear and hydrated but after a while I started breaking out and noticing my T-zone getting VERY oily during the day. Unfortunately I haven't really been able to rule out what caused this; whether it was a certain product or just hormones or something. I stopped using my sunscreen a while (the boj one) but that didn't help. Then I stopped using my cerave foaming cleanser all at once and I thought it helped at first but it didn't.  

The skincare I use right now is:

AM
-roundlap moisturising cleanser (just bought that yesterday tho)
-purito panthenol rebarrier cream with low ph
-Beauty of Joseon sunscreen with rice prebiotics

PM
-Haruharu wonder oil cleanser
-Roundlap moisturising cleanser (just bought that yesterday tho)
-purito panthenol rebarrier cream with low ph

I'm a little afraid of using acids yet since I feel like I still have to restore my barrier.

My question is: any idea how I can solve my oily (mostly) nose and breakouts? Any idea which product it could be? 

(I thought it could be a sensitivity for niancenamide as well since it is in the moisturiser and the cerave cleanser I don't use anymore, since I've reacted to it before when I used the the ordinary niancenamide serum)

Any help will be greatly appreciated!!",koreanskincare

If anyone's used this toner before, let me know your thoughts!)

Furthermore, they don't have listings for COSRX Snail Mucin in essence in bulk anymore! They always always always had listings to buy in bulk sets! I was really hoping to stock up! I know I can just 'add to cart' multiple times but why would they get rid of bulk listings when its such a popular product? I assume they're low on stock

Lamiche ""Club Miz""

Ever Skin Clinic

Both of these seem rated highly on Kakao and Naver, which means they're known and respected by locals (which is great!).

What I'm trying to understand is whether the cost will be comparable between the two.

I'd like to get 1-2 laser treatments (vBeam, Excel V, or Synergy MPX) for acne redness and melasma.

I'd also like to get 1-2 procedures for my double chin (inMode or injection).

Also 3 facial moles removed.

I've reached out to them both about price but they only answered a few of my price questions.Ever Skin Clinic said 275,000 won for 1 laser treatment + 11,000 per mole. Lamiche just said 330,000 for 1 laser treatment, but then jumps to 5 laser treatments costing 257,000 won for each laser treatment.

1686088388.0,Should I cancel my Stylevana order?,"I usually check my sources.  I've ordered from YesStyle, Oliveyoung, KoreaDepart, Dokodemo (Japan), StyleKorean, and BeautynetKorea.  I've never had any issues. It's always clear how items are shipped, if I have to pay for shipment and if I will have to pay for import fees.

I saw that Stylevana was having a sale, and Dr. Dray had recommended products from them, so I didn't do my due diligence. I am seeing terrible reviews everywhere that orders are still processing a month after. I also (and this is my fault) ordered one product that won't be available for 30 days.

I reached out to their customer service, and they reached back (I guess they don't work weekends, but I cannot get mad at that.) Their automated response still said that things were slow due to Labor Day.  Hrrm, that was May 1st, and I wrote to you in June. This echoed what I had read in a lot of reviews by then.  I asked them to remove the one product so my order could ship. I just checked, and my order is still processing with the Beta-Glucan product (the one that needs to go) in my order.

How long would you give them, and would you try to get your money back from their customer service or your bank? (I used a credit card via Paypal to pay).  I always expect around a month to receive my products in Canada when ordering from Korea or Hong Kong. That way, I'm usually pleasantly surprised!

I was told it was free delivery with Stylevana, and I had to pay $ 38$ (I took regular mail insured).  I'm glad I took this insurance now... if my products ever get out of their processing state.

I plan to wait another week, and if things are still processing, I will start the cancellation procedures. I'm sad because that Oat skin is something that I wanted before beginning Tret! I am also out of my beloved PKY essence. (Yes, that's entirely my fault).

What is your opinion, Korean skincare lovers? If I get this order, I will stick to the trusty websites. This was an ''it's the last few days of May, and that sale will be over soon- better order now.'' impulse buy.  I want everything that I ordered.  I'm just mad at myself for taking an influencer's word for it without doing my research first (that is also 100% my fault).

Are you getting your SV orders? Did they get better since the slew of negative reviews?

EDIT: I just emailed their customer service AGAIN.  Here is a copy of what I sent them with specific info redacted: (sent 6/8/2023 at 4:30 pm est time).

Order #BWSV.......

Your agent said they would remove the item listed below as it's a 30-day item, and my order would be shipped.

Product Number: BSSEIUN00002NOC02M0015

ColorNMillilitre15mlOrdered: 1Unit Price: CA$12.83

My order is still processing.¬† I order a lot from Korea and Hong Kong.¬† This is not normal.¬† If my order has yet to ship by June 15, I will do a chargeback.

Respectfully

Plo83

Edit: 6/14/2023

I just received a tracking number. My order has left today according to this. It took 15 days and a few emails to get SV to ship my order. I have never waited that long for an order, and I should consider myself lucky since some people ordered at the beginning of May and are still waiting.  I will be lucky if I get my order and no products are close to expiring. I will NOT be ordering from SV again.

Some people claim that they never had an issue with them, and I believe them. When ordering from SV, it's the toss of a coin deciding your fate. I will shop with reputable companies that have never let me down before. This is the first not-so-positive experience I've had when ordering from anywhere in Asia. Most services are professional and work to fix any issues rapidly. SV has been the exception.

Edit: This will be my last edit. I received my order. Everything was there. It was well packaged.

That said, my messages were ignored, and my order was ''processing'' for over two weeks. When I emailed giving them a few more days before a chargeback, my order changed status rapidly, and things started moving. Things went quickly from then on.

SV has severe internal issues if you check the reviews. They need to stop spending on influencers and publicity to fix their problems. If I ever order from them again, it will be because I cannot find a product elsewhere, and the order will be for a meagre amount. I won't place a 300$ order again, that's for sure. That way, if my order takes three months, I won't be sweating and praying that I either get my goods or my money back.

From my own experience, I cannot call them a scam, as I've received my items. It's still the worst customer service and ordering process I've ever experienced from any website. I do not want to scare anyone away from ordering from HK or South Korea. I've ordered from many other websites before and only ever had pleasant experiences!",koreanskincare

I have pretty normal skin, with the rare breakout. I do always have enlarged pores and sebaceous filaments. Especially on my chin and nose. My current routine is as follows 
Morning: cerave renewing SA cleanser, vital beauty serum with hyaluronic acid and lactic acid,  vanicream moisturizer with SPF
Evening: cerave hydrating foaming facial cleanser, cerave SA cleanser, vital beauty serum, Cetaphil healthy renew eye serum, versed overnight barrier balm

I am not at all attached to any of these products. I do live in Colorado, so it's a relatively dry climate. Please give me all of your tips.

1712859583.0,Am I doing too much? ,"A few months ago I got really into Korean skincare. It doesn‚Äôt feel like my skin is showing desired results and I‚Äôm wondering if I should change things up. My skin type is oily/combo skin. 

Current AM products: 
I wash my face with a cleanser. I use vitamide mediheal toner pads. I then use jumiso all day brightening serum. Followed by Dr. G lotion. 

PM products: 
Anua cleansing oil, followed by anua gel cleanser, anua toner, then I use a retinol (laneige, but recently purchased somebymi retinol), lock it in with Dr.G lotion. 
On the nights I don‚Äôt use retinol, I exfoliate either with mediheal toner pads or salicylic acid. 

I have noticed that the oil cleanser has brought some blackheads to the surface, but also my closed comedones haven‚Äôt really cleared, my chin and forehead are my main problem points. I‚Äôve noticed my skin is definitely less red and a more even skin tone. My skin also glows, and is super bright which is nice. 

My main concern is that my forehead and chin still have texture, and I‚Äôm not sure why this hasn‚Äôt changed much over the past few months. 

Tldr; I‚Äôve been using products for about 3 months now with minimal change to the texture on my skin. Am I doing too much? ",koreanskincare
1712725731.0,New for me again,"Hey guys! Went to my favorite place for skincare pickups and finally decided to buy ones I have been eyeing for long time! These products are going to round out my skincare routine strictly for nighttime

I have been obsessed with Mixsoon for hydration and wanted to try the bean cream! It will be my first Korean cream I ever owned!

Skin1004 centella has been a life saver for calming my redness and decided to get a even more intense ampoule for my night routine. I currently use the tree-tica version of this ampoule and wanted something thicker :)

I believe Tirtir is so elite; decided to choose this eye cream over the axis-y-only cause my store didnt have it. Which was a sign to me that is will be the one! 

The last thing I decided to grab was some cotton pads since I ran out of pre soaked ones. I will be using those to refill my anua toner pads by soaking them in the heartleaf toner.

I dove headfirst into the world of Korean skincare, thinking I had found the holy grail for my combo oily sensitive acne-prone skin. The Anua Heartleaf Cleansing Oil, Round Lab Dokdo Cleanser, Dr.G Red Blemish Moisturizer, and Skin1004 Centella Sunscreen seemed like the perfect match at first. For the first few days, my skin felt great, but then everything changed. Now, after cleansing with the oil and foam cleanser, my face stings. When I apply the Dr.G moisturizer, it burns, and don't even get me started on the agony of applying the sunscreen! in dry down it made my skin flaky and red I switched my moisturizer thinking its a soothing one with the Torriden Dive In Moisturizer, but even that caused a burning sensation. I know my skin barrier is damaged, but everything I try just burns my face.I've tried to be patient and give my skin time to adjust, but the burning and stinging sensations are just unbearable. It's frustrating to feel like I'm doing everything right, only to have my skin react this way. I've read about the importance of a healthy skin barrier and how it affects everything from hydration to acne, but it feels like a never-ending battle.

I have a combination skin, not sensitive but sometimes reactive, I live most of the year in a cold climate and other in a hot humide one. I won't review the european products aside if someone ask for it in the comment as it may be out of this sub:

\- Belif Face wash: One of my favorite face wash, it smell so fresh and leaves my skin really good.

\- Isntree Mugwort calming mask: It's okay. I think I need a stronger products as it didn't do much for my black heads.

\- Belif Toner: It is my 3rd bottle, I often go back to a lot of Belif products as I love the brand on my skin, but it's quite pricy in my country so I always wait the sales. It is quite moisturizing especially in the summer and again I love the smell.

\- I'm From Rice Toner: I haven't tried it for super long but it's not my favorite from the brand, it is very moisturizing though. I probably won't buy it again.

\- I'm From Fig Essence: My favorite product from the brand !! I know it didn't got as much love as the Mugwort or the rice toner but I absolutely love it. I like my products to have a nice smell and sadly for me it doesn't smell of anything. The packaging is lovely too and since the products is not cheap I appreciate to have a pretty product at least, it makes me enjoy the experience even more. It is VERY moisturizing but I haven't got more pimples surprisingly as I have an acne prone skin. And it gives me an amazing glow. So far I only use it an night.

\- Klairs Midnight calming blue cream: I haven't tried it for very long and my skin didn't reacted to anything so far so I didn't used it to notice calming effects so I may update the post later.

\- Abib Heartleaf calming pads : Love the packaging, but I didn't noticed a huge calming effect on my skin. It is a nice toner pads to use in lazy mornings though.

\- Belif moisturizer : I have the vitamin C and the original cream I love them both very much, they smell amazing and don't irritate my skin, they are the face creams I often go back to.

\- Some By Me Retinol Intense serum: I haven't noticed any change in my fine lines so far but the retinol in it didn't irritated me at all. The bottle is beautiful too BUT I find it very hard to get the product, I don't know if it's because it is thick or the pipette thing that doesn't get enough products.

\- Kahi Multi Balm and Aqua Balm : I love them ! They are expensive for the quantity and there is probably cheaper option out there but I don't use mine every day and I have them for quite a long time. As you noticed the packaging and smell of a product is important to me, a bland bottle with 0 smell makes me give up skincare very quickly. And they look really pretty and smell great, also it is really good to moisturize some parts of the face that turns dry. I don't use them all over my face (except the Aqua balm which is a SPF 50 I love to use it especially around my eyes) but the multi balm except some colder days in winter I would use it on some small parts of my face. I think I would buy them again !

\- Round Lab sunscreen: I love it, it is very light and doesn't sting my face like a lot of SPF creams

\- Laneige Mist bottle: Loved it too, it is empty now but I plan to buy more. When I bought it I didn't had high expectations as while reading the main ingredients it wasn't anything clear to me like the I'm From products which have rice, figs, mugwort, pears... so I was confused what the Laneige really had or if it would really do something. Surprinsingly I worked great for me, I feel I could spray it in the hot summer and be good in the day, no serum, no cream! So far it's winter so I use it as a regular toner and I really liked it. It worked better at calming my skin also than a lot of heartleaf and cica products.

\- Belif Cica cream: I didn't liked it so much, it must be the Belif product I liked the less... The packaging is great but I don't like the smell at all, it doesn't have the same smell as any of the other products. Also it didn't calmed my skin during irritated times. I don't think Cica really do much for me honestly.

\- Soo Good pads: They are very nice as a mask but the jar takes a lot of place and I wish it had a more elegant look as the Abib ones. I don't like the smell of it very much though..

\- Heimish All Clean balm Mandarin: very nice balm, smell like orange tree flower (I prefer the Banila Co Orange cleansing balm though which smelled like a fresh orange juice !)

\- Goodal Vitamin C serum: LOVE IT the smell just put me in such a great mood in the morning and gives a great glow as most vitamin C serums. I do find the pump is a bit hard to push.

\- Erborian Oil: It feels nice ( I am not a fan of oils in general but it is a good one).

\- Erborian Ginseng serum: LOVE IT, I also loved their Yuzu serums but they are so expensive... Bottle is beautiful, products smells great and you can see results so fast !!!",koreanskincare

I've read articles, watched tik tok videos, and read through skincare subs such as this to gather as much info as I can. I have to admit it has been overwhelming, but also very exciting on this journey of self care. 

 I'm trying to create a good list of reputable Korean skincare retailers that will ship to the U.S. The below is what I have gathered so far. The reason for this post is two fold:

1)  Can you take a look at the below list and add any I might have missed, and/or share which ones you have had the best experience with, best shipping speeds, and/or best sales and deals. 

2) I have very sensitive, very dry skin, with rosacea redness. When my skin gets irritated, my rosacea flares causing a few hives, these hives turn into little whiteheads the next day, if left untreated they turn into scars. I am however not acne prone. This only happens with rosacea flares when some product doesn't agree with me/stress/other irritant. Do you have any holy grail product recommendations for my skin type? I also find that my skin needs mild exfoliation more frequently or it just starts to look very dull. Although I only try to exfoliate 1-2x a week, something gentle that can still keep me radiant on a more frequent basis could help me. 

If you've read this far, thank you so much! Below is the retailers list I've compiled:

*Olive & Young
*Jolse
*Soko Glam
*Style Korean
*Yes Style
*Blooming Koco
*Live K-Beauty

1705724990.0,I'm confused about my skin barrier and I don't know if I should buy an exfoliant,"Hi! As a complete beginner to korean skincare (and skincare routine in general tbh) I've seen that you should exfoliate chemically (use AHA/BHA) once/twice a week so your skincare absorbs well, but I also heard that it's not good to use actives on damaged skin barriers. After doing a bit of research, I'm very confused about my skin barrier.

I don't have extreme skin conditions, just quite a few acne scars, hyperpigmentation, texture, etc. Usually I have combination to oily acne prone skin but it tends to get dry because of the weather rn. I haven't established any sort of routine yet, I'm still in the process of developing one and buying things so the only things I use rn are a cetaphil cleanser, neutrogena toner & a nivea moisturizer

After cleansing and waiting for around 10 minutes, I feel dryness in my skin and if I smile or stretch my skin a little it feels very crusty and dry and it hurts quite a bit. When I apply my toner after cleansing, it stings quite a bit the first time. I'm not sure if this is because of the seasonal dryness or if its because I have a damaged skin barrier, or even if it's because I use too much product (I always single cleanse and I use around 4-5 pumps and massage for around 1 minute). I don't want to damage my skin further so I'm not sure if I should use exfoliants, but I also want the products I will buy to absorb well.

1. Has anyone else had a similar case? I would like some advice. Is there any sort of test I can do to see if my skin barrier is okay?",koreanskincare

I struggle with blackheads and a bit of texture on my cheeks and chin. **I mainly want to get rid of: texture, dark spots from acne, blackheads.**

I have always wanted to switch completely to Korean skincare because I found that the formulation of their products are generally more gentle to the skin than most Western products. 

My current skincare:

* **Cleanser**
   * CeraVe Salicylic Acid Cleanser
   * CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser
* **Toner**
   * Good Molecules Niacinamide Brightening Toner
* **Serums \[\*I switch the ordinary or good molecules up when one of them runs out\*\]**
   * The Ordinary Niacinamide or Good Molecules Niacinamide Serum **(AM)**
   * The Ordinary or Good Molecules Hyaluronic Acid **(PM)**
   * Good Molecules Discoloration Correcting Serum **(AM and PM)**
* **Moisturizer**
   * Etude House Soon Jung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream \[I recently just switched to this because it is currently winter here in Canada\]
* **SPF or Sunscreen**
   * CeraVe Ultra-light Moisturizing Lotion SPF 30 \[I ran out of this\]
   * Good Molecules Sheer Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30
* **Acne treatment**
   * Good Molecules BHA Clarify Gel **(AM and PM) \[I use this after serum\]**

I need y'all's recommendations, advices, comments regarding this. :(( I had a bad experience with Dermas so I don't really want to go to them. What should I change or not change? What should I or should not use?

Thank you! :(",koreanskincare

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm kinda big noob in the skincare game and I‚Äôll explain my strange post title. 

I‚Äôm f21 and as of now, I don‚Äôt had many skin problems, appart a bit acne on teenage years, far from being annoyed by. And since I‚Äôm 18-19, I‚Äôm pretty much done with that without any treatment or specious skin care routine. 
Theses last weeks, I would like to have a better skin routine and I‚Äôve passed some hours to get know more about it. I‚Äôve bought 2 serums for ¬´¬†normal skin¬†¬ª, with good appreciations, good ingredients for doing the best and have a great glass skin like I see on social media (in a big part on TikTok or Pinterest if I‚Äôm totally honest, but with some cheaper products possibly üòÄ). It‚Äôs been one week I actually mix them with my own moisturiser cream and sunscreen two times a day, morning and night after cleaning my face but i don‚Äôt see any noticeable difference, in better or in worse. it‚Äôs weird, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just coincidence that‚Äôs my skin become a little bit textured by zone, or if I touched my face without very cleaned hands and so my skin react to ? Or if serums are juste bad for me and my skin.?. :/ 

I should say, I‚Äôm not really patient and If it would have noticeable good difference, when it comes, after how long does it have an effect? 

That‚Äôs the point ! ^^ someone who can enlighten me on this subject?

1712530176.0,Thoughts on the COSRX Peptide Booster serum ?,"Hi I was curious if other people tried the COSRX peptide booster serum ?

So far I am using it as a ""pre toner"" product, as I often wash my face and don't put my skin care products immediatly after, especially in the morning, I would rinse my face, prepare my coffee and once it gets ready I would do my skincare routine. So I would use that peptide booster right after rinsing my face so it doesn't get too dry and so far my skin seem to love it. Most of the products I use are oriented towards hydratation and glow finish so I can't say if it did a difference but my skin seem to like this product well.

My skin type is combo, in summer it's more oily, in winter it tends to be more dry/dehydrated. I have been getting a lot of compliments on my skin recently, I don't think it is only due to it but I do think it helped to the overall look of my skin.

My routine is currently:

AM:

* rinse my face with water
* COSRX Peptide booster serum (then I usually do something else as my skin hates when I apply my products too quickly)
* Laneige Cerapeptide Toner or  Glow Recipe Cloud Berry Essence (depends on my mood)
* Serum Goodal Vita C
* Face cream Mary & May (if my skin is dryer I would use the black tube with Idebanone, if I feel my skin is plump enough with hydration I would use the green tube that is more of a gel (followed by spf if I go out)

PM:

* Belif face wash ( or I would double wash if I have lots of makeup/spf on)
* COSRX Peptide booster Serum
* Laneige Cerapeptide Toner or I'm From Fig Essence or Mary & May Black Berry Essence
* Serum Erborian Ginseng
* Face Cream Mary & May Idebanone ( sometimes I switch to one of the moisturizer from Belif)
* if needed I would add a night oil from Erborian, their ""Skin Therapy"" oil, but I rarely need it.

I have pretty normal skin, with the rare breakout. I do always have enlarged pores and sebaceous filaments. Especially on my chin and nose. My current routine is as follows 
Morning: cerave renewing SA cleanser, vital beauty serum with hyaluronic acid and lactic acid,  vanicream moisturizer with SPF
Evening: cerave hydrating foaming facial cleanser, cerave SA cleanser, vital beauty serum, Cetaphil healthy renew eye serum, versed overnight barrier balm

I am not at all attached to any of these products. I do live in Colorado, so it's a relatively dry climate. Please give me all of your tips.

1712880867.0,help! Flaky around my mouth and slightly irritated.,"Help! It‚Äôs been about three weeks since I added new Korean products to my skin care. First pic is with makeup, it flaked off completely and second pic is without makeup.

Old routine that I was doing for a few months (bc I was broke and couldn‚Äôt afford my old products)/

I‚Äôve always used CeraVe foaming facial cleanser to wash off makeup or just wash my face in the morning and night. Never given me an issue. 

I‚Äôve been using Peach Slices Snail Rescue Blemish busting toner for awhile too and haven‚Äôt had an issue with it. 

And lastly I‚Äôd just put CeraVe moisturizing cream.

Recently I started using soonjung 2x barrier cream again, and started using (for the first time) beauty of Josean revive eye serum, and I‚Äôm from rice toner. 

So my routine right now is:

1. Wash my face in the am with cerave cleanser, rice toner, wait for it to dry.

2. beauty of josean eye cream, wait for it to dry, 

3. then the peach slices snail rescue, wait for it to dry, 

4. and end with the soonjung 2x cream.

 Sometimes I also add a layer of cerave cream on top after the 2x barrier cream but I haven‚Äôt done that in a bit

I wash my face and do the routine in the am, and before bed as well. So I do this 2x a day, and at night I put frownies on after too. 

Am I doing something wrong? 

I‚Äôve used the 2x barrier cream before and it never gave me issues. I used the peach slices snail rescue before without any issue. The only two really new products I‚Äôve incorporated is the eye serum and rice toner but I‚Äôm only flaky around my mouth. Could it be the toner? Or the snail rescue? Is 2x a day too much? Help!! I was really excited for this routine but it‚Äôs flaking my skin and is also kind of irritated. Again, it‚Äôs only around my mouth!",koreanskincare
1712859583.0,Am I doing too much? ,"A few months ago I got really into Korean skincare. It doesn‚Äôt feel like my skin is showing desired results and I‚Äôm wondering if I should change things up. My skin type is oily/combo skin. 

Current AM products: 
I wash my face with a cleanser. I use vitamide mediheal toner pads. I then use jumiso all day brightening serum. Followed by Dr. G lotion. 

PM products: 
Anua cleansing oil, followed by anua gel cleanser, anua toner, then I use a retinol (laneige, but recently purchased somebymi retinol), lock it in with Dr.G lotion. 
On the nights I don‚Äôt use retinol, I exfoliate either with mediheal toner pads or salicylic acid. 

I have noticed that the oil cleanser has brought some blackheads to the surface, but also my closed comedones haven‚Äôt really cleared, my chin and forehead are my main problem points. I‚Äôve noticed my skin is definitely less red and a more even skin tone. My skin also glows, and is super bright which is nice. 

My main concern is that my forehead and chin still have texture, and I‚Äôm not sure why this hasn‚Äôt changed much over the past few months. 

Tldr; I‚Äôve been using products for about 3 months now with minimal change to the texture on my skin. Am I doing too much? ",koreanskincare
