1713039118.0,Wondering if this facial experience was normal?,"Hello! I tried out a new spa and I'm trying to figure out if I'm just being overdramatic or not. I normally get clear and brilliant laser somewhere else and had never had a traditional facial before.

When I signed up for the facial via class pass I received zero instructions and wasn't asked anything about my skin/history. The website of the spa doesn't say anything about preparing about this particular facial either. Since I didn't sign up for any peels or anything intense, but out of caution I stopped my tretinoin and my vitamin c about 3-4 days before to prevent excess irritation just in case. 

I walked into the spa room & was asked if I wanted champagne, and I said no because I don't really care for drinking, especially at 1 pm. **She kept asking me until I said yes.** She said that it was Saturday and that I should relax, which I get to an extent, but it was definitely weird. When she got it for me, she awkwardly stood there while I drank half of it and then I set it down.

Now, I have very clear skin that I've worked very hard towards and I definitely stare at it way too much, so I know where I have congestion, a few superficial whiteheads, and where I don't. I also know the difference between sebaceous filaments and blackheads, but it doesn't seem like this esthetician did. She worked with a very heavy grip on my face. It has been multiple hours since this facial and everywhere she worked is still very red and sore. My skin was mostly smooth and any congestion was not noticeable before walking into this spa. Now my face is very noticeably red and swollen and my nose is throbbing. The neck/shoulder massage was okay, but she massaged my face after the extractions, which hurt and all of the skincare she used really stung the open wounds on my face. She also left a clay mask on for so long that it dried out my skin and felt uncomfortable. Eventually, she washed if off, put on some serums that stung again, thanked me, and **told me not to wear sunscreen** after my facial. 

At the front counter she told me that my skin is too oily for moisturizer (I have dry skin) and that I should try this cleanser, which after looking at the ingredients is made out of **essential oils** and a $60 hyaluronic acid serum with no ingredient list. She also told me that she couldn't use vitamin c on my face today because I use prescription skincare (I use vitamin c every morning with no irritation while using tret) and that next time I should stop for two weeks beforehand, which doesn't make sense if I'm not doing anything other than steaming, extractions, and a face/head/neck massage.

I got home, and I looked in the mirror again and **I still have a few superficial whiteheads** after she squeezed my face so hard that its been hurting for multiple hours! Those should have been the easiest to get rid of. This spa has hundreds of five star reviews on class pass, yelp, and google. I did careful research beforehand and I feel like I accidentally went to an awful place by the same name. I can't tell if I'm being overdramatic or if I'm right to be disappointed. I gave her a full tip because I felt awkward doing anything less and didn't want to give class pass clients a bad rep for not tipping well. I was so excited for this and I'm trying not to be sad.",Skincare_Addiction

1713030170.0,my acne has mostly cleared…now what? ,"hi, i posted on here about a month or two ago regarding my progress i made in terms of acne. my skin has really cleared up since using TO’s azelaic acid (night), and paula’s choice salicylic acid (morning). on top of that i use a 4% benzoyl peroxide face wash. 

here’s the thing : i’ve been using these products for about 6-7 months now and they’re almost all out. i’ve been a bit scared about continuing with so many actives as i think it might damage my skin barrier, and also my acne is pretty much gone, and i don’t feel the need to continue with a somewhat harsh routine. but i’m scared that won’t be the case and my acne will return.

I'm taking a break from retinol for now because i wanted to see if it's cerave which is causing the blackheads and closed comedones (i used their PM facial moisturising lotion in the past and it gave me blackheads, so i assumed that my skin did not like cerave that much).

i also tried BOJ rice probiotic sunscreen but unfortunately it clogged my pores and caused closed comedones too. that's why after i finished using it i changed to iUnik sunscreen and it's working alright so far.

are there any tips to help my skin? 🤔",Skincare_Addiction

1712863448.0,Any advice is welcome,"About 6 years ago, I fell for this deal to get laser treatment done to my face.   I had a lot of issues related to health problems from previous years, and I was hoping that getting the laser would help... they made so many promises of the ""benefits"". 

 At the time, I was often mistaken for being honestly 20 years younger than I was.  It was nice, I still had the fullness in my face and literally no wrinkles.  

 I went in for my treatment, had numbed my face first, with numbing cream.   The person who did the laser treatment really turned up the heat.  It was heating the dermis and the subdermis, quite a lot.   Then as I'm leaving, they began to hard sell me for deals to pay for the next treatment.    That money is gone forever.

I went home, and didn't expect to anything but positive results.   Over the weeks and months, my face began to change in ways that horrified me.    I discovered the intense heat they had put into my face, had caused the death of the fat cells in my face - cell aptosis.   Suddenly, I just didn't even look like myself anymore.  And when I touched my face, all I felt was BONE, all over.  It was horrifying.  The skin became loose, and that looseness went South, into my neck.  The absolute worst.   Any expression I made would pile up skin, making rows of lines along the upper cheeks and on the forehead.  I always had a very smooth forehead with no expression lines, at least not horizontal ones.  

I suddenly had all this loose skin,  with nothing to support it anymore - major loss of volume.   That youthful look was definitely out the door.  

They also went really hard core over the corners of my mouth, so now there are divots there, and it makes it look like my mouth is drooping at the corners.   When I do my makeup, I have to do so much highlighting to try to balance out all of the hollowed out stuff.  

Yesterday, I saw a picture of me just before the treatment and then after, it was really interesting to see how small and angular my face had become.  

 I tried fillers, mainly so I could stand to look at myself.  I found them to be traumatic to get, and scary, because of the risks of losing your vision.  I just don't have any money for maintaining that.   You have to keep getting them, and over time they can really make your face start to get distorted.   I was told I needed fat transfer, but that costs thousands of dollars.  

I tried a variety of things, but over time my skin has developed a really pronounced, orange peel texture.  

I added a picture of just a small section of my cheek area.   

I was just wondering if anyone has any advice?  Something I can do that isn't expensive, but might improve the problem.    This isn't normal aging for me, it came on rapidly after that horrible laser treatment.  I have spoken to others online who had the same type of laser treatments, and the same type of results.  They were just as devastated as I was.  

Thank God I didn't go back for more treatments, they kept telling me I just needed to get more and it would look better.  Absolutely ridiculous.  I would have ended up looking like Skeletor.  

 If I had the money, I would honestly get a lower face/neck lift, but I will never be able to do that.  

 I currently have to wear a lot of sunblock if I go out, because I am a transplant patient.  Been doing that for many years, so I get minimal sun on my face.   I have done a lot of the common things you can do at home, like glycolic peels and microneedling, plus serums and such.    I haven't done a peel in a really long time. It's just kind of hard to affect something that goes so deep.   I also do facial exercise regularly, which helps a little bit.  ",Skincare_Addiction

 toners, I just finished using the peach slices snail rescue blemishing toner and the exfoliant acne toner by peach slices. I wanted to switch it up and try something new today so I just purchased the Byoma brightening toner that has lactic acid, mandelic acid and barch extract as some of the ingredients. 

my serums are good molecules hyaluronic acid and good molecules niacinamide serum.

for exfoliants I purchased the Paulas choice BHA liquid 2% travel sized, my second night using it and I woke up with my skin feels soft. if all continues to go well I will def purchase the bigger size.

moisturizer I use byoma moisturizing rich cream (im almost out so idk if I want to repurchase or try something new) 

any moisturizing recommend for oily skin should I continue with cream or try gel moisturizers ?

1712768441.0,Accutane + Tretinoin Success Story,"Hi everyone, success stories were my lifeline when my acne was at its worst, so I wanted to share mine. For context, I’m only wearing sunscreen in the first photo. 

I’ve struggled with severe acne for about 6 years, but experienced acne since the beginning of high school, until the end of my bachelors degree (so 8 years total). 

It’s been 2 years since I completed 9 months of Accutane which was a miracle for me. It drastically reduced the amount of new break outs I was getting. As far as clearing up acne goes, I give Accutane full credit because I was on Differin Gel for 8 months, then used Tretinoin for nearly 2 years prior to taking Accutane. I had also tried countless antibiotics, birth control pills, and facials in an effort to reduce my acne. Don’t get me wrong, Accutane is a hardcore drug that left my eyes insanely dry and itchy. My joints hurt to this day, but it was worth it. 

After Accutane, I still occasionally broke out and my face was covered in scars. I decided to give Tretinoin another try, but I heard that the cream may not be acne-prone friendly. Since I used Tretinoin before for a pretty extensive period of time, I was able to jump straight into daily use of 0.1% Retin-A Gel. 

To this day, I use a very similar nightly routine that I followed while on Accutane:
1. Albolene if I’m wearing eye makeup
2. Dove unscented beauty bar 
3. Tretinoin on damp skin (I know that many people find this very irritating but I love how easy it is to rub it in…)
4. For a while I used Cerave in the tub, but it just wasn’t moisturizing enough for me. I moved onto Vanicream, but it left my skin flaky in the mornings. Still less flaky than Cerave. I recommend Vanicream to anyone with active breakouts, because I currently use Nivea in the glass tub. In the past, I felt like it would break me out but right now it’s the only cost effective cream that leaves me glowy and dewy. I’m not encouraging anyone to use it, it just works for me.

In the mornings, I just slap on sunscreen. I don’t have a favorite yet but I really dislike any Cetaphil sunscreens. 

I hope to stick to this routine forever, because whenever I stray away from it and add another active, I wake up to 7 new breakouts instantly.",Skincare_Addiction

I have in the past abused my skin to steroid creams around eyes due to itching and would itch and rub my eyes like anything cause i just didn't understand what I was doing I used to rub it a lot due to itching and still do sometimes I would constantly fight with my under eye like pull rub and have not handled it properly in short 
Due to all this I have experienced like a dent like a visible hollow not like the general hollow eyes but like a hole in which things can fit now like a drop of water can be held like a container .. not explaining properly but it is like that..
The doctor said that due to abuse with a lot of steroid tretinion etc creams the skin has dried out and no hydration etc and the rubbing has caused that hole or dent because of some fat pad has moved and the volume there is break down he said only option is filler cause laser will irritate and then mrf because of ice pick scars and overall texture brightening cause now there is no glow on face and has turned very dull and dark

I know 99% that I cannot reverse the the fat pad loss but does anyone know if it is possible naturally like any thing helps with this I really don't want to go the filler way but I am also depressed at how old this makes me look
I have so many lines steroid darkness and now hollowing with very deep tear trough lines so much of me tells to just do it but then I also read a lot of comments on this forum how people regret all these treatments in long term fillers and even mnrf causing more fat and volume loss

Any suggestions please I am already depressed and always in front of mirror feeling hopeless with life but don't have guts to do these treatments

Re-added these to my cart. The rosemary shampoo is out of stock now and got the nest perfume delivered to my brother’s house in US. I have a hobby/fixation with collecting perfumes like pokemon :’) hoping the nest are decent? got them around 27 CAD/21 USD, the rosemary shampoo for like 30CAD (without 15% tax 😔)

I’ll split the Dr. Dennis with my 66 year old mother, I really want to boost her confidence and self esteem 🥺 also thinking of cutting them even further in half (or 4 pieces?) and placing them in air tight containers so they’d last longer. Although I’m worried they will dry out significantly/not be as effective as told by a sephora employee. They are quite expensive but seem to work wonders on me and I’m hopeful they’ll help her 🥺 i also got them cuz they seem to have everything? Like i don’t need to buy additional serum/retinol/acids and stuff, wondering if that makes it more cost effective in the long run? got her the bioderma blue retinol day/night cream set from shoppers as well but couldn’t give yet since she lives on the other side of the world..i want to spoil my mom but hopefully I can do more when my income increases 😔

Got the necessaire deo to lighten my dark underarms, would have preferred unscented but it’s completely out of stock. Was considering getting the cheaper ordinary glycolic acid but was wondering if it’d be harsher compared to this? Im also currently doing laser hair removal treatment for my PCOS. Got the spf lip balm to help with my pigmented lips too. I already use laneige lip mask and sugar scrub but see no difference :(

Got the necessaire rosemary shampoo set cuz I have very less hair :( my braids and pony tails look so pathetic, thinner than a horse tail. Got the white one too as a clarifying shampoo although considering returning if they are too similar. Was hoping to get a gentle shampoo that wont dry my hair out too much and help with my hair loss. I had been using the bondiboost rosemary thinning set and they seem much oilier (?) but not sure how effective they’ve been so far🧍🏻‍♀️tbh im wondering how significantly different they are from cheaper drugstore shampoos and if I can just cut down my costs if i get no silicone/sulphate ones. Any cheaper alternative for hairloss would be much appreciated!

The lip liner and eye glitter are my very first, wanted to go with ‘universal’ colors so I never have to buy another again. Getting the lip liner as a natural color since my lipstick always looks like it goes outside 😶‍🌫️ The eye glitter is purely for my brother’s wedding.

Will use the clay mask once a week to help with my blackheads/Sebaceous filaments. I have the Kate Somerville sulphuric wash but want to use it infrequently cuz its pretty costly and always out of stock lol.

Feel lukewarm about the tarte lip balm, was wondering if I could just use burt bees transparent lip balm and lipstick instead. Got the body wash since I liked the smell in store. Never used a sol janero product in my life but hoping it’s moisturizing cuz i struggle with very dry skin.

Apologies for the essay :’( I’m still quite a noob with self grooming/skincare/makeup despite being 25.

Hello everyone,   

35 M   

In the last three weeks, I've been taking care of my facial skin  again, so I did some research and watched some videos/feedbacks/youtube  etc.   

But since I started using these products, something is different, on  the negative side. Because I notice that I have a lot more acne, small  red spots, and whiteheads in the nose area, and two of them haven't gone  away (left marks, didn't squeeze) even after two weeks.   

I have the feeling that the Cerave lotion (Blue package) is not  working very well for me, probably I need to use a moisturizer that is  for combination skin (dry and oily in the T-zone).   

I also noticed that my dark circles are much worse (I use all the  products in the eye area), I would also like you to help me indicate a  good product for dark circles, and I don't rule out makeup, but it  should be something very discreet.   

After waking up:   

&#x200B;

* Cerave hydrating cleanser     
 
* Shave     
 
* Uriage - thermal water     
 
* Nivea super sensitive skin after shave     
 
* Cerave hydrating lotion     
 
* Korean SPF50 sunscreen or Australian Gold mineral SPF 50+     
 
* Vaseline Lip therapy.

I’ve historically had pretty good skin, although I’m super pale & so discoloration / blemishes do stand out more. I stay out of the sun & have always worn sunscreen religiously. In the past six months I’ve noticed a ton more hyperpigmentation/“age spots,” & weird orange peel texture which I wasn’t having issues with before.

Right now I’m using the ordinary niacinamide & hyaluronic acid at night, a vitamin c serum & sunscreen during the day, and a retinol cream 3-4x a week at night. Also use an Aesop face oil for moisturizer. I live in the deep south so don’t struggle too much with dry skin. Definitely need to up my water intake as I’ve been slacking on that, though.

Other possible factors; I went back on the pill in January. I eat relatively healthily & don’t drink alcohol or smoke, but I could stand to cut down on sugar & caffeine.

1712509296.0,HELP: How do I explain this to my boyfriend,"Hi guys.

Before I explain, trigger warninf for a very very bad skin practices.

I am writing this out today because my boyfriend revealed his shocking routine today and I am not yet well versed enough to explain to him that what he has been doing over the couple of months is very questionable to say the least.

He has been experimenting with minoxidil for his beard and I truly support him if it's going to give him more confidence. I wasn't paying much attention to it except that he puts it on in the morning and evening and we cannot kiss or mush faces together.

I asked him today what his routine entails and he says that he puts the product on, sometimes uses microneedle roller and also uses retinol as he heard it helps with the effect. I was kinda taken aback with the roller as I know it's not really a good idea to use it especially with actives that can irritate skin and also knowing him he probably doesn't wash his face before.

I asked him if he knows that the roller can spread bacteria around his whole face if he doesn't wash his face and the roller properly beforehand. He said that I am a silly goose for thinking he is not prepared, because before he rolls his face he uses propylalcohol to spray his face down and the roller.

I was shocked at that. 

Honestly I am not very good at giving reasons why what he is doing is extremely irritable to his skin (not really sure how he has not broke out like crazy, my man's having better skin than me). I told him that the minoxidil is irritant on its own, couples with a 3% retinol is vile and that the straight up alcohol is going to dry him out. He's been doing this for months now. To be fair, he does this roller thing every 3 days, not everyday.

Can someone please give me an explanation of why what he is doing is dangerous so I can properly educate him on this? And or maybe if this is actually good, how? How come I spend hundreds of dollars and hours watching skincare advice, having a solid morning and evening routine and still have worse skin than this man?",Skincare_Addiction

Just plain old medicine and simple skin care. About 4 months ago, I signed up for an online dermatology service. They gave me 3 months of doxycycline and a clyndamycin+benzoyl peroxide topical treatment. I paired these with sunscreen and an unscented, noncomedogenic moisturizer.  I also used a tranexamic acid serum in the mornings. After I completed the doxycycline and clyndamycin, I was prescribed a tretinoin+spironolactone+tranexamic acid topical treatment. Here is my current routine:
A.M.: Splash face with water, apply sunscreen and moisturizer,  
P.m.: Wipe off dirt and grime with cold cream and warm washcloth, apply 5% benzoyl peroxide cream and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes, wash face with unscented face wash, moisturize, apply half pump of prescription cream.

It fixed the issue in the first tube and I went thru it. Its alright overall. Now as for the seconf tube, I put it in hot water, same thing, same time and when i come back to check on it the product was spilled out into the water.

 I panicked and I tried cleaning off the tube on the outside because now it was super sticky. Again tried soap and it was still sticky and made my hands super sticky. I applied it then next day only to find that the formula literally separated. Im literally so fucking disappointed rn. I paid alot to get my hands on one because Rhode isnt available where im from and honestly I really liked the scent and wanted it to work but now im just so over it. Never buying this again.

I have thyroid issues before this and I have uterus fibroid removed like 5 years ago. I do not fit into the typical mold of beauty where women have long tresses of hair, smooth and flawless skin and typical petite size. I was the opposite of almost everything in the mold. I used to feel sad when I see someone else with smoother and flawless skin and thought why I can't be like them. I have also received the unkind remarks from ignorant people commenting that I am not pretty and my skin not porcelain smooth. I used to feel so small.

I have tried every remedy for my large pores and pitted scars, but none of them seems to have long lasting effect. I lived in Asia Pacific, the pressure to have a flawless and smooth skin is so immense, every time I scroll through social media, 99.99% its either about the glass skin or some post saying who and who(maybe celebrities, influencer or some girls who just keep posting about themselves on social media) have flawless and smooth skin. 

And then one day I thought why am I giving so much f\*ck on all this kind of thing, I am living the best time of my life now. I am grateful I managed to overcome my thyroid issue and learn new thing in life.

1712359303.0,Which one: Glow Recipe Niacinamide Dew Drops or Good Molecules Discoloration Correcting Serum,"Hi All!

I'm pretty new to skincare as a whole and have been working on learning ingredients and getting the specific brands/serums for the results I want. My routine is pretty simple and I am trying to find a niacinamide serum to settle on. 

I like the consistency and feel of both the Glow Recipe Niacinamide Dew Drops and the Good Molecules Discoloration Correcting Serum. I've been using the Good Molecules serum for the last month and like the results so far. But I wanted to branch out into different brands. Since I don't like layering serums, I've been sticking to a niacinamide one as my main serum, but which works better? I tried to look at the ingredients, but I only understand what they are and not how the amounts of them are factoring into my product. 

Which one would help most with my goal of evening out my skin tone and getting rid of dark spots? Any advice would be great in helping me pick between them. Thanks!

1712278162.0,Microneedling scarred my skin,"I have no reason to write this post but to inform anyone who's considering it to think carefully before jumping onto the microneedling bandwagon.

I got my 1st (and only) session done 2 months ago per my dermatologist's suggestion as a solution to slightly enlarged pores on my cheeks. My session was fairly light, I didn't feel much pain and the recovery entailed no peeling or any major redness. I didn't suffer throughout the process and was actually excited about the potential results.

Fast forward to a few weeks post-procedure, I notice a skin-colored formless bump (only lightly raised) on my nose. It was like a little flesh-colored flattened island. 

Then, I decided to shine a flashlight across my face to create some shadows and investigate that bump further, when I suddenly found track grooves all across my face: cheeks, temples, chin. I also noticed other ""flattened islands"" on my cheeks. 

The skin was scarred and worse off then when I started. I'm devastated. You can't see it much if you're not increasing the lighting contrast around my face with a flashlight, but it's enough for me to realize that it's caused some damage to fairly healthy, young (33 y/o) skin.

I have an appt with the dermatologist soon and will keep you posted on what to expect from now on.

If anybody else has experienced the same, I'd love to know and feel less alone in this. It's really been affecting my self esteem.

Tldr: got 1 micro-needling session done and regret it immensely

Edit: The procedure was done 2 months ago, not 4 as I previously thought (just revisited my phone pics for accurate timing)

—

UPDATE (10 MONTHS):

There is DEFINITELY light at the end of the tunnel! 
*you can find photos of my original issue in a comment below*

A little context: For months after that procedure, I began getting a crazy amount of acne. I was used to getting the usual pre-period pimples that were cystic, hurt a lot but never really surfaced, but these were more aggressive and much more spread out. I'd have at least 4-5 active pimples constantly (which was not the case before microneedling) and they'd show up on random places like my forehead (which was random for my usual pimple experience).

I started treating the pimples and in the process, I feel like I exfoliated my skin enough over time that the texture seems MUCH better now 10 months later. It's a slow process but hang in there! 

My routine included an acne soap that contained zinc, benzoyl peroxide 10% (I can handle this well) and azelaic acid at night (which is the most underrated acid in the universe imo). I didn't use the azelaic acid every night—I kept it to ~3x a week.
For sun protection, I relied a lot on my heavy duty hats because my skin was sensitive. I stayed indoors a lot so I didn't always lather in sunscreen but I absolutely always wore a hat when outside.

My texture improved over time but if you're being sold on more microneedling so you can ""see improvement after more sessions,"" I would highly encourage you to think twice in case you already had a bad reaction to the first session like I did. 

Hope this helps!",Skincare_Addiction

1712262616.0,Have You Given Up on the Skincare Industry? I Have.. Kinda,"I’m in my 30’s and I have dry skin which has led me to spending a good amount of money the last three years buying different types of moisturizers, cleansers, serums and more to benefit my skin. I’ve also dabbled in buying several collagen and peptide products because they claim to make a difference and prevent/repair age lines etc. 

I don’t really have any major skin concerns other than maintaining moisture, but I used to look for things that claim to prevent aging because I didn’t feel it would hurt to take preventative measures.

Now that I’ve done research on ingredients, I’ve cut down on spending and minimized my skincare routine to 5 things:

1. Castile bar soap
2. Exfoliating glove
3. Jojoba oil
4. Sweet Almond oil… may switch to Apricot 
5. Either the Weleda Baby Cream or the Palmers Vitamin E Concentrate Skin Barrier Repair Moisturizer.

I don’t wash my skin everyday to prevent excessive dryness. When I moisturize my face I dampen my skin with water and massage 1 or 2 oils on my face, neck and chest. I make sure to spend a minute or two gently massaging the under eye area, smile line area and my forehead to let the oils get deeper into the skin. 
If don’t use oils and need to use a cream to avoid the excessive shine the oils create, I’ll use one of the moisturizers that I mentioned.

I no longer spend money on anything that claims to be a “miracle repair” product or markets themselves as “anti-aging”, contain to have peptides/collagen etc. I don’t but exfoliating products because an exfoliating glove lasts longer and can be purchased in bulk, which I have done.

Jojoba oil has many benefits for the skin since it contains Ceramides and is very similar to the skins sebum. It also absorbs easily and is practically free of any scent. There are also other oils that can even benefit **OILY skin** as well, like *dry oils*.

DON’T LET THESE SKINCARE BRANDS FOOL YOU WITH THEIR FALSE PROMISES AND MARKETING SCHEMES. Yes, some brands offer great products but many are just cash grabs. 


Please research the ingredients in the products you use and the benefits of natural ingredients like carrier oils.

My main concerns in the last few months are that I frequently am getting small red spots and small whiteheads every morning on my nose and cheeks. I also am noticing some darker spots on my cheeks that I'm worried is sun damage from when I was younger. See photos. Ignore my bloodshot eyes, I just put in contacts and they irrated my eyes lol.

also, I know my skin isn't ""bad"" especially as compared to when I was younger. I just want to make sure I'm using the best products I can for my type of skin.

About a month ago i stopped using paula’s choice BHA as it wasn’t doing anything for my skin and i thought these bumps may be from a compromised skin barrier so really simplified my skincare routine. however it’s been over a month now and they still seem to be there.

The main issue I’m having with my acne is post inflammatory hyperpigmentation and so I want to start using a retinoid. :0

Currently, I only use a cleanser on my face and think it would be a good idea to first  find a good moisturiser and sunscreen. Once my skin gets used to them I would then start putting retinol all over me!

My current cleanser is Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser and I think I have a normal skin type maybe slightly oily.

If anyone has any recommendations on which moisturiser and sunscreen I should get it would be much appreciated… I also don’t have super deep pockets so I cant spend £40 on a moisturiser

Finally :) I was giving adapalene 0.3/2.5 from my cousin but it is past its expiration date, is it ok for me to use that or should I try and get something different

1712145142.0,[routine help] the bane of my forehead,"

Hey! 
So my skin has always been weird in that whenever I do nothing to it it looks great (and I mean nothing)- no breakouts or spots, maybe some bumps under my eyes that I think are called millia? But the second I try a skincare routine, even if it’s nothing but wetting my face and then putting moisturiser on, it all goes to hell. When that happens I stop using anything until it goes back to normal…and then I tend to try again cause I don’t want the products to go to waste (dumb I know)

Sometime last year I tried again and used an expired (I didn’t notice at the time) vitamin C serum that I think caused this nasty reaction on my forehead. I got these little bumps/rash that itches like crazy and then got crusty/scabby and itched more. In the end I cut some bangs so I wouldn’t see it and stop picking at it. It cleared up to the point that it’s not itchy anymore, BUT it is VERY dry and flaky and will react negatively to anything other than Vaseline. I also have dry patches like that on an eye lid? 

Me being a dumbass, did a face mask (made of rice idk it was sticky) last night and now it’s back to being red. Not itching or dry and flaky, just red and raised, and I figured I could ask and see if anyone knows wtf it is or how to get rid of it. I do plan to see a dermatologist at some point but it just hasn’t been possible yet.

Hope this makes sense and would really appreciate any advice!!

I immediately stopped using the cleanser and my skin settled. I then decided to try a salicylic serum and got the exact same reaction. For whatever reason my skin does **not** agree with salicylic acid *but* when I did use it it improved the appearance of my blackheads so much!! Wondering if anybody uses a product that does the same thing but no salicylic acid in it? TIA! ",Skincare_Addiction

This is where my struggle began, for the last 4years I've been trying different cleansers, the cleansers ive tried are from the brands: la roche posay, cerave, cetaphil, neutrogena, the ordinary and the inkey list

But every single one of them is uncomfortable to use, upon washing it off, its like im trying to wash off oil from my face, the cleansers leave behind a slippery film when trying to wash it off and i absolutely hate it, the end result was my skin reacting horribly to all of them. 

I've been asked to try asian skincare, especially the cleansers, as they're not known to leave behind a film/lather, and I might, once i get recommendations. 

But in the meantime does anyone have any good recommendations for cleansers that dont leave behind a film when washing it off, i like that squeaky clean feeling.

1712073533.0,2 things to consider when choosing a dermatology in Korea,"I’m a local Korean 
Went to over 20 different clinics probably closer to 40 (consultations and medications included) to treat acne, acne scars, pigments, enlarged pores. I probably had procedures done at about 10 different clinics. 

I would like to share a bit of my personal experience after spending thousands of dollars  on so many different clinics to treat my acne prone skin and pigments. But keep in mind that this is just from my personal experience, but also… these are just really basic things all Korean locals would consider before choosing a dermatology but I noticed that most foreigners don’t … 

1. Make sure the dermatology has board certified dermatologists
 - This is probably the most basic & important thing to consider because getting your skin treated at a “dermatology” without board certified dermatologists is just like getting plastic surgery from a family physician or a doctor who isn’t a specialist in plastic surgery or going to a gynecology run by a non board certified dermatologist.
- I realized this after seeing less improvements, getting deeper scarring and receiving risky acne prescriptions from NON board certified dermatologies

2. Check the kind of laser machine they have (this is the SECOND most important thing not the first)
You need to make sure that the dermatology machines are being used by someone who specializes in dermatology!!!

So when i was 19/20 i used to use retinol, niacinamide, salicylic acid, moisturiser at night and vitamin C in the morning with sunscreen. I know i was really stupid and that probably would’ve caused my skin a lot of damage but my skin was doing fine. 

I stopped after i turned 21 and my basic routine became really simple sunscreen in the morning and moisturiser at night. When i turned 22 i was scared of pre mature ageing because i was getting slight bags/wrinkle under my eyes a few months back i tried retinol again but again i stopped using it. 


My current routine is. 

Morning- double cleansing with a basic foaming cleanser and cerave hydrating cleanser and then biore sunscreen (the japanese one) 
Night - double cleanse again with the same cleanser and cerave moisturising lotion

Now i really want to get back into using serums and i want to do it right. I want to use one serum and one only. It’s either niacinamide or retinol. Please help me which should i pick and what should i do. I’m 22 right now i will turn 23 in two months, is it too early for me to start retinol (even thought i did it stupidly without any knowledge) or should i stick to niacinamide for a while till im old enough to use retinol

I have seen several dermatologists and the solution is usually tretinoin or birth control. I regularly use tretinoin but have stopped birth control a little over a year ago. 

I get maybe 2 pimples per week dependent on hormone levels and it wouldn’t be so bad if they didn’t leave a red mark after they heal. So while I may have a pimple for 2 or 3 days, the red marks stay from 3 weeks to sometimes months. This makes my face look like I’m constantly having a huge acne breakout when I’m not really. 

I regularly use tretinoin and SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic. And I’ve tried BBL and I get moxi laser treatments a few times per year.

Is it ok to do so? If I wait for it to heal before doing so, it's less effective as most of the melanin(?) is produced in reaction to the wound, so applying during the healing process should reduce this drastically right?

i went to a doctor: i live in dhaka where everyone is money opportunistic, people get ripped off easily i went to a dermatologist for the first time, i told her all my problems, then she prescribed some skincare products and recommended me to get a 4500tk treatment. which shocked me and i felt like the doc was trying to earn money then treating me. i just didn't say anything and left. (u might say 45 usd is less but in dhaka its a lot)  
this are the products recommended by the doctor: acne bye soap, facid bt fugidal cream, safi blue moisture and the 4500tk treatment.

morning routine: i use saliclic acid neutrogena face wash with garnier meceller water, then i apply benzoyl peroxide and sometimes layer with ordinary niancinamide 10% with zinc. then end it with revolution skincare Thirsty Mood Quenching Moisture Gel if i am going out i apply benton mineral sunscreen

1711744168.0,The Skincare Trap: Escaping the Cycle of Dependency,"I have been using skincare products since I can remember myself. I might get some hate for what I am about to say but I'm prepared to face the consequences. While many of us have been led to believe that these products are essential for achieving healthy, radiant skin, I stand before you to challenge this notion.

Let us consider for a moment the sheer number of skincare products available on the market today. From cleansers and toners to moisturizers and serums, the options seem endless. Yet, despite the multitude of choices, our society is plagued by an epidemic of skin issues such as acne, dryness, and sensitivity.

Why is this the case? I propose that skincare products themselves may be contributing to the very issues they claim to solve. Consider the ingredients found in these products—harsh chemicals, artificial fragrances, and preservatives, to name a few. These substances can strip the skin of its natural oils, disrupt its delicate balance, and even cause irritation and inflammation.

But perhaps even more concerning is the notion that skincare products may be creating a cycle of dependency. Just like any other addiction, our skin becomes accustomed to the constant influx of products, leading to a reliance on them for basic maintenance. This dependency not only undermines the skin's natural ability to regulate itself but also perpetuates a never-ending cycle of consumption.

Furthermore, let us not overlook the environmental impact of our obsession with skincare products. The beauty industry is notorious for its excessive use of plastic packaging, contributing to pollution and waste on a global scale. By perpetuating the myth that skincare products are necessary for healthy skin, we are not only harming ourselves but also the planet we call home.

So, what is the solution? It is time for us to reevaluate our relationship with skincare products and prioritize simplicity over excess. Instead of relying on a multitude of products to achieve perfect skin, we should focus on nourishing our bodies from the inside out—through a healthy diet, proper hydration, and adequate sun protection.

In conclusion, I urge you to question the status quo and challenge the notion that skincare products are the answer to all our skincare woes. Let us embrace our natural beauty and work towards a more sustainable and holistic approach to skincare—one that promotes health, not dependency.

Thank you.",Skincare_Addiction

These little white bumps look like  clogged pores, but they probably aren't. They always appear IMMEDIATELY  after washing off the micellar water, my micellar water does not contain  comedogenic ingredients, do you know what could be the cause? It looks  like a cyst. I have combination/acne-prone and sensitive skin. All other  products I use are safe for acne, there must be something wrong with  the micellar water, it's definitely not clogged pores, because they  appear a few days after using the micellar water, but these appear  immediately after washing them off with water. Moreover, the problem is  not only cysts, but also these small bumps around the jaw and cheeks.  Does this look like an allergy or clogged pores?

I read that having anxiety can cause this because your fear-sweat tends to smell worse..   

What helped somewhat was glycolic acid toner on my armpits but it didn’t help enough..   While I was using toner i saw my bottle of Thayer’s witchhazel and i decided to give it a go.   

Hoooooooooly shittttt it worked from day one. No coloured stains. Less sweat (wetness) and ZERO odor. Like fresh as a daisy after a stressful day at work and hopping around like bunny…

1711615270.0,Damaged my skin with retinol,"Hello, please i need your help.
 i used to have oily skin especially the T zone, acne and acne dark spots. I used topical retinol with avene moisturizer and avene cleanser. My skin was so red like burnt. But i didnt know it was bad. I thought its normal and was happy with the results retinol is giving me. My skin was dry af. Note that i have never ever had a dry skin. It was always oily. After like few months of using retinol i wanted to get pregnant so i stopped. The redness faded a little bit. But my skin is still dry even after 3 years has passed. I used moisturizers, vit c, sunprotection, cleansers like i tried many brands and many routines and always had acne. Then when i had my newborn i was sleep deprived and tired so i stopped using any products on my skin and since then i never had acne. Only like very very few breakouts (maybe of something i ate or applying makeup) also note that since i stopped using foundation my acne reduced alot. But i dont like my skin its not clear. I have a lot of dark spots from acne. How do i fix my dry skin at first. I know its not my skin's nature to be dry. And secondly what can help me fix my dark spots due to breakouts ?

1711600451.0,Help with routine?,"Hi all! I need some advice with my skincare routine. 

For some context, my skin used to be pretty good until I switched to the nexplanon birthcontrol since then, my skin has been consistently breaking out. I used to have bad acne when I was in HS so there is some scarring. 

I have started seeing an aesthetician and have had two salicylic acid peels done on my back. This has helped a bit with scarring, but I’m more concerned about my face right now. I have an appointment booked with a dermatologist for May 17th. 

I USED to use strictly cerave products, the list is as follows;
1.) Hydrating micellar water (Still use to take makeup off).
2.) Hydrating cream to foam cleanser for dry to normal skin.
3.) Hydrating serum with hyaluronic acid.
4.) Renewing SA lotion.

I stopped using these because I found it dried my skin out insanely, and made my issues worse. My aesthetician has me using the following currently in this order;

AM CARE
1.) AlumierMD Acne Clarifying Cleanser
2.) AlumierMD Acne Balancing Serum
3.) AlumierMD HydraClarité Moisturizer

PM CARE
1.) Cerave Hydrating micellar water (To remove makeup if I wear any that day)
1.) AlumierMD Acne Clarifying Cleanser
2.) AlumierMD Acne Balancing Serum
3.) AlumierMD HydraClarité Moisturizer

I have found that this has helped a lot and I find my skin isn’t as dry, but I’m wondering if there is anything else I can do to improve my skin texture and quality? I picked up retinol and a vitamin C serum but I don’t know where to add it in my routine. Is there any other things I could add to help with my breakouts and that could reduce scarring and improve my skin texture? 

Thanks!! :))",Skincare_Addiction

Current products:
Sulwhasoo oil cleaner + foam cleanser
Medik 8 Vitamin C ( just started a few days ago)
Avene moisturizer ( I used to use tatcha water cream but can no longer buy it in my current place) 

Products that I have tried
Estee Lauder anr serum : nice result but can't use everyday otherwise clogged pores
Skii Pitera essence: absolute nightmare. Clogged pores and painful pimples that I never ever get.
Kiehl moisturizer: so unimpressed
Paula choice retinol: love the result but can't use because of pregnancy

1711586168.0,Can anyone help me with these? ,"Hii! I'm F(24), skintype : combination. I've been doing skincare for a while but kinda fell off a few months back and now I'm getting into it again. For the past two months I've just been trying to repair my skin barrier and get rid of hyperpigmentation on my forehead and uneven skintone on my face. My current skincare routine is as follows: 


**Morning:**

1. **Cleanse** (sometimes I skip this step if I feel it to be extra stripping) - Simple facewash/ Cerave foaming cleanser 

2. **Sunscreen** - Neutrogena sheer zinc (I skip moisturizer as it feels too heavy ony oily/combo skin)


**Night:**

1. **Cleanser** - Same cleanser (I don't use makeup so don't double cleanse)

2. **Exfoliate** - [be_minimalist aha bha exfoliator](https://beminimalist.co/products/aha-bha-10) (Twice a week)

3. **Serums** (for pigmentation) - [Alpha arbutin 2%](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2) and [tranxemic acid 3%](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa) - I sometimes layer them or apply only one and alternate on days as TA one has mandelic acid in it so I don't apply that always for fear of over exfoliation

4. **Moisturizer** - Cerave moisturizing lotion. I sometimes apply snail mucin all in one cream over it for extra moisturizing (on the days I exfoliate)

5. **Basting** - This is not exactly a daily step but once a week I'd just cleanse, moisturize and apply zinc oxide ([Cetaphil](https://www.cetaphil.in/baby-skincare/cetaphil-baby-diaper-cream/IN_7613036454308.html) one) over my face to help with any inflammation. This idea is from Dr Shereen idriss' YouTube channel. I tried it and it helps my skin. The next day my face is supple and moisturised. 


I've kept it reasonably simple but I've been struggling with a few skincare concerns lately and I can't get rid of them. I've put [PICTURES HERE](https://imgur.com/a/KZPNnAn). 


1. The main concern is those spiky whitehead kinda things on my nose and on my chin below my lips. No matter what I do they don't go away. I've tried salicylic acid in the past (leave in and facewash, separate times) and the exfoliator I'm using now has glycolic+lactic acid in it but still it doesn't do much. And in the corner of my nose there seems to be blackheads? So I'm confused, are those blackheads or whiteheads? Idk what those are. Any suggestions to get rid of them?

&nbsp;

2. Texture on my face. It has improved a lot recently but still. Any way to improve more on that?

&nbsp;

3. Uneven skintone. There's a bit of pigmentation around mouth and forehead. Redness too, here and there. I'm using alpha arbutin and that has been working. The spots on my cheeks have faded a great deal. Think I'll continue with it? I was thinking of adding [Kojic acid](https://www.apollopharmacy.in/otc/kojic-skin-cream-25gm?utm_source=google&utm_medium=srnb&campaignid=17280487350&adgroupid=&keyword=&device=m&adtype=pla&product_id=KOJ0003&utm_campaign=Pmax_Pharma_ROI&utm_content=%5Badgroup%5D&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwh4-wBhB3EiwAeJsppPPrsu677UFbcBeusVtQHBAHVGUo1IV_6TY0Y17IufqlfZ8sOb0VAhoCbjMQAvD_BwE) slowly but would that be too much? 

&nbsp;

There's pigmentation in the lips but it has always been that way so I don't suppose I can do much in that regard. 

&nbsp;

ALSO I have these moles? on my face. They're visible on my cheeks like black dots. And have a few just below my eyes. They don't cause any problems and have been there since my childhood. I wanted to ask if it's safe to apply actives on them? (not the ones below my eye as I don't apply any actives near the eye area) I've been applying products on my face for quite sometime now and nothing has happened but still I wanted to ask. Will applying retinol etc be ok? 

&nbsp;

That seems to be the end of it. Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help the above given points. Thank you.

1711574664.0,This may be controversial.. retinol / clearer skin making you look older?,"For a while I have been seeing people around me using retinol, ánd I have also heard about the tiktok- insta-hype of Gen Z-ers saying they look older than millenials.

For that last one, I have seen a lot of 'explanations' in reactionvideo's or from influencers, blaming the older look on the Gen Z-clothing style, to the use of botox, to vaping ect.

Personally I have wondered sometimes if it also might have to do with their skin looking 'too good'.. Some of the women at my work for example have flawless skin using retinol in their routine, and so do many Gen Z-ers.

However, flawless in the sense of the lack of redness, acne, very visable pores, ect.

This may sound weird, but having some oil shining on your face, some spots here and there, some enlarged pores around your nose... also makes you look..youthful?

Atleast for me, I feel like your brain automatically connects that with youth / teenager / a young skin that still creates a lot of own moisture. While women in their 40's / 50's often have a dryer skin.

I used a moisturizer aswell (neutrogena soothing clear) afterwards but I don't think that's working either and I'm considering switching to a different product.

Now I accepted my skin is maybe not soothed for too much skincare. So i just wash my face with the cerave hydrating cleanser AT NIGHT, no moisturizerin.

They work really well for my skin, but both of them require that you apply to damp skin. I am currently using Dermalogica’s hydrating & toning mist to dampen my skin before applying my other products, and it works really well. 
I am looking for some info/other recommendations to replace the Dermalogica mist as it is becoming too expensive for me. I have oily/acne-prone skin, so I try to keep my products in line with that. 

I live in South Africa, so I don’t have a lot of products available to buy, but I do have access to the following brands:
• Vichy
• La Roche Posay
• Eucerin
• Cetaphil
• CeraVe
• Lelive
• Curaloe
• SKIN Functional
• Neutrogena
• and for my fellow South Africans on this sub, all other products in Dischem/Clicks/Takealot etc. 

I am looking at La Roche Posay or Vichy’s Eau Thermale spray. Would this be a suitable replacement?

I have two hyperpigmentation marks on the corner of my mouth. I am also getting pimples on my upper lips which leaves marks. The foundation for the rest of my face doesn't match mouth area making it look ashy. Also my hand and neck area so much fairer than my face. I used to go out in the sun a lot and also used a lot of pimple products which made my face sun sensitive. So I got tanned.

Please advise me how to get rid of the hyperpigmentation. I would really appreciate any advise.

usually i use:
AM: - washing face with water
- CeraVe moisturising cream for dry to very dry skin (but i want to change it for the warmer weather)
- when really sunny out i used the inkey list sunscreen but i think it leads to break outs and it hurts my eyes
PM:
- jojoba oil for cleansing 
- Dermasence cleansing Mousse (it‘s with glycolic and salicylic acid) 
- cerave moisturizer 

i had zero skintexture 3 weeks ago but somehow it worsened
 when i tried the niacinamide from the inkey list and the hyalusome from dermascence (glycolic acid and vit C) to get it of it, it got only worse, i think it dehydrated my skin to much so :/ 
to repair my skin i made the tiktok flaxseed gel did a mask for 30 min twice a day for 3 days and it really improved a lot so now it‘s looking okey again (as seen in pictures before the white heads were way more and my skin was looking very unhappy)

1711417129.0,"Just started getting into skin care, just would like some advice on my current routine, and any suggestions.","For some background info, I'm an 18 year old mixed (African-American/Caucasian) male. I've never done any serious research on skin care, just some casual Google searches and YouTube scrolling. Nor have I had any form of uniform skin care regiment, besides simply washing my face in the morning and night, either when I'm in the shower, or simply using a wetted wash cloth.

I use five main products right now, and I'm about to introduce a sixth that I just picked up at the store today.

Here are the products: 
—Eucerin Eczema relief cream (For hands and forearm, day and night use.)
—Harry's Exfoliating Face Wash With Peppermint (To cleanse and exfoliate my face, morning and night use.)
—Bath & Body works Daily Face Lotion with Hyaluronic acid (For face moisturizer, day and night use.)
—Vaseline Petroleum Jelly (For lips and Eyebrows at night.)
—Harmony Goat Farm Mango Madness Lip Balm (For my lips, day and night.)
—Neutrogena Ultra Sheer dry-touch sun screen SPF 70 (I'm gonna introduce this for use during the morning and evening, on my face, neck, hands/arms, and legs when I'm wearing shorts.)


I've started a new skin care regiment as of recent. I could use some advice on the nuances of it.

In the morning and night, I have practically the exact same routine, with an extra step, or two, at night.

I start by lightly washing my face with water, before taking a clean paper towel or wash cloth, wetting it, and gently running it over my skin to get rid of any current product. Then, I'll wet it again, before using my Harry's exfoliating face wash, and squeezing a pea size amount onto my hand. I'll then lightly dab that with my finger, and evenly place dots on my face, before wetting my hands and gently rubbing it into my skin. After a few minutes, which I usually spend washing my teeth, I rinse it off with water, and repeat the previous step of lightly wiping any remaining residue off with a paper towel or wash cloth. 

Then, I wet my skin lightly once more, before using my Bath & Body works face lotion. I use the same technique of applying it as when I apply my face wash. I then apply the lip balm on my lips, then apply the Eucerin Eczema relief cream on my hands, and a little on my forearms. Then I'm on the go, ready to start my day. I plan to also take an extra step to apply my new sunscreen after the face lotion and eczema cream, putting it on my face, neck, hands/arms, and my legs when wearing shorts.

At night I'll also put on some Petroleum jelly (Vaseline) on my lips over the lip balm, to lock in moisture. I'll also apply a little on my eyebrows, because why not, maybe they'll become softer.


That's about it, all advice is appreciated, I am a novice. Though I heard it's bad to use a physical exfoliate (which I think the Harry's thing is because of the little gritty stuff) more than once a week...and I'm using one basically twice a day, but it says it's okay for daily use, and some reviews have said that it's gritty-ness is less than other face washes, so...I don't know, any suggestions on that front would be appreciated.

P.S.
I've just started this whole routine less than a week ago, and I haven't had any outbreaks or suspicious sensations so far. I've been using the Eucerin on my hands intermittently for years, basically whenever my hands dry up. I used the Harry's for a little while a year or two back, but not as frequently as I am now. The lip balm is also somewhat new, and I haven't used any in months. Everything else is brand new, so the moisturizer, vaseline, and sunscreen.

They're probably just expression lines but I literally never actually noticed them until January and now they won't go away. They're seriously pissing me off and I hate them so much.

I don't really have a skincare routine and yeah I probably should've wore sunscreen more. Also I def don't drink enough water daily. Am I just f'd now? I'm so young and I don't wanna worry about this.

They can't be true wrinkles, they're super thin and I've put some cheap moisturizer in them and a section of the top literally disappeared but unfortunately came back after 10 minutes. I've been washing my face every night and putting in this moisturizer every day (albeit sometimes I forget some days, sometimes I've gone a week without it) and yet its still there. I guess I'm still not drinking enough.

I don't get how I was just as unhealthy and didn't have a skincare routine just two years ago but didn't have these lines but then I just wake up one day and now they're always there. So annoying :(

1711377793.0,Is SPF mist sufficient enough for sitting in front of a window?,"Hi all! 
So I absolutely know the importance of good SPF and always wear sunscreen when I leave the house. My favourite is La Roche-Posay 50+ invisible fluid. I always wear it when I'm going anywhere.

However I work from home and recently moved so now my new desk setup is in front of a big window. I have blinds but like to let some light in the room so I usually have them half down and the sun does often shine on my face. So I'm worried about sun exposure from sitting in front of the window for prolonged periods of time. But if I'm just at home all day and not leaving the house, I don't want to use my LRP sunscreen because it feels like a waste, you know?

So I bought a sunscreen mist (Sculpted by Aimee Sun Mist SPF 50+) which I thought might work as an alternative. I know that mists don't offer the same protection but since I'm not directly in the sun, I thought it could work for when I'm sitting there.

What do you think? Would they be good enough protection?",Skincare_Addiction

I dont get the large pimples anymroe, its now more dry patches of skin around my chin and the small red spots/bumps on my cheeks with occasional small pimples on the bridge of my nose and forehead. I've tried multiple moisturizers to include clinique dramatically different moisturizing gel (which i used successfully before I began seeing a derm),  la roche posay moisturizer, Cerave moisturuzer, Cerave syrum, Aveeno oat gel, and neutrogena hydro boost. There are more but these are the most recent. 

My derm told me to use Dapsone in the AM and spot check with Tazarotene in the evenings, which I do, but some days it feels like the dapsone is too thick and my moisturizor on top of it feels like every time I touch my face, the top layer of product is peeling. Other days I feel like my nose and forehead are so oily it's all I think about. My derm doesnt have any recomendations for lotions/syrums/moisturizors except for Cerave and every new product I try works for a few weeks and then I go back to having the same problems of too oily or peeling. 

My current routine is (AM) face wash, dapsone, and hydroboost and (PM) Wash face, Aveeno syrum, Tazarotene, and Aveeno oat get. I like my evenings routine, my skin doesnt feel like there are a million layers on it and i wake up feeling refreshed, but I need something to help me get through the workday whether it be a change in routine or a new product to try.

I M(17) recently started skin care back in August of 2023 as I had pretty good skin, no acne but I wanted a nicer brighter face. During the winter im pretty dry skined, but seasons are starting to change and I can notice my skin getting a little oiler? I found this out as during the winter Lotions are to light but now they seem to work fine. I would say I have combo skin leaning to the drier side, but for some reason Im hearing talk about mabey haveing a dehydrated forehead so I want to look into that.

Skin Type: Combo-Dry

Sensitive Forhead maby?

AM: Loracho Posay Hydrating Cleanser for Dry, Ice my face, Seoul Vit C Serum, round lab 1025 dokdomoisurizer, Corsx Sunscreen.

PM: Cera V Cream to foam cleanser, RoundLab 1025 Dokdo moisturizer

Once a week I exofilate with paulas choice( only done this twice)

Concerns: I just got this new moisturizer, and I cant tell if im using to much or its to heavy, becaus its leaving with this greasy kind of feeling. I just got this moisturizer which replaced the Cera V moisturizing lotion which didnt work in winter but might work in the hotter days, and before that I used Cera V Moisturizing Cream which was alright.

Should I be adding more products into my regiment like the round lab or not like toners, and snail mucin, im really new to Asian Beuty so I dont want to go in.

Problems/questions:

\-Bumby/ Acne forehead that I cant seem to fix

\-I cant tell if im using the right moisturiizer( not enough or to Much)

\-What my skin type is im very confused as what if its Dry or Combo or deydrated

\-Why I am getting forhead acne??? Its very random and why i dont every get acne their

\-Same thing with my cheeck acne

\-How long shoud I give a product before its fully working like my new moisturizer

1711081680.0,Figuring out a routine so I can feel good about my face again. Anything that would be beneficial to add?,"Hey guys. 
So I’m a 28 almost 29 year old mother to four beautiful kids. I noticed yesterday, or rather finally admitted to myself, that I have put myself on the back burner. Skin care, hair care, just general care for myself. And I’m fed up with it. I need to start doing things to make me feel good again. 

So one issue that I have is keratosis pilaris. It’s on my arms and my face. I have tried several things that don’t seem to work but for right now I think I just need to focus on how INSANELY dry my face is. It’s flaky, I have discoloration around the nostrils, it’s bumpy and just… ugh I hate it. 

So I pulled some skincare products out tonight and decided to just go for it and STICK WITH IT. First I used my cerave moisturizing cleanser, then a face cream, and then a couple drops of oil and gently patted it in. 

I already feel like it’s a bit better, feels softer for sure. I still feel some flaking but I’m hoping that will get better as I go. Is there ANYTHING else (budget friendly lol.) that would help to include, or a different brand of cleanser/face cream? I think the one I grabbed was ponds. It’s been sitting in my vanity drawer for awhile. If this helps my KP in the process I’ll be elated. But one step at a time :)

1711061626.0,Desperate need of Sunscreen recommendations (pls read entirely),"First post on this sub so hello everyone 👋🏻
I'm writing this because I don't really know what to do on terms of sunscreen.

I feel like I tested many sunscreens and my skin seems to like none of them...
I tested skin 1004 hyaluronic acid sunscreen, and instree HA one and they had the same results, little bumps on my face, clogged pores I think... After that I realized that my skin didn't like HA (I tested a serum with HA and my skin didn't react well)...

But the thing is that HA isn't the only ingredient that my skin doesn't like....my skin isn't okay with niacinamide as well (I tried several products with niacinamide and my skin didn't like it at all)
I feel trapped cause there's practically niacinamide and HA everywhere 😭 I can never be set free.

A while ago I bought THANK YOU FARMER sunscreen, the light sun essence and the water normal one...I thought that because there isn't any ha or niacinamide (at least in the sun essence they weren't any), my skin would be okay ...but no...I had pimples and my skin texture got worse...there's many oil in the composition and Yuka rated the sunscreens badly  (both rated 0/100 😬)

I also apply makeup after so maybe it contributes to clogging pores ?

Sunscreen's really important so I really would want a good one to stick with...do y'all have any recommendations (*without* **hyaluronic** **acid**, **niacinamide** and a bad ingredients list)(btw I have *acne*, *oily* on the T zone and *pore-clogging* skin)( ik that's hard to find but my skin is just sensitive 😭) ?

1710992340.0,It gets better over time,"I had a bad acne breakout in early 2022 which started from small clusters of ccs in my forehead which spread upto my cheeks and I tried everything possible but it just didn’t get better. I used to have few breakouts earlier but it used to be just concentrated on my t-zone. After a friend’s recommendation, I finally visited a dermatologist and he prescribed me accutane for 6 months. The first few months, it felt like the medication was bringing out all the acnes to the surface and making it worse but it did get better over time. What was left after the breakout was even more disappointing for me bcoz I had picked and popped the acnes and it left me with scars and indentation-like marks. I visited the dermatologist again and he told me such marks were inevitable after such a harsh breakout session. This was the time I got into skincare and I started using retinols, azelaic acid, etc2. A year later, my skin had gotten significantly better. I kinda feel like skin gets better on its own overtime and its not something we can expect to see results overnight. Also recently, I’ve started using TO peel weekly and this has also helped a lot.

But I was adament to get a perfect glass skin. 

I went to a skin therapist that helped me build a skincare routine. At night I would:
Clean with Avène- clearence gel together with the ordinary squalane for double cleansing. Then I would end it with bioderma sebium hydra moisturizer. 

On morning I would only use water, and use the moisturizer again and then use vichy- capital soleil 50 spf.

1710959255.0,finally mastered my skincare routine !!,"pic order - skincare routine products , sides of face before morning wash and a month into routine , mid day pic after work after a month into routine 

after struggling with cystic hormonal acne since freshman year of high school (and it was BAD to the point smiling or furrowing my brows would irritate the crusty pustules and i’d ooze pus) it died down on its own in the later years and during covid i really tried to get on top of my skincare . it was hard . having adhd and autism , self care doesn’t come easy so it was a heavy on n off battle from seeing an aesthetician and using harsh products .

finally , this year , just a month back , i’ve setup this perfect routine for myself and it’s helped IMMENSELY . my scarring and hyperpigmentation is going away , active acne is under control , and best of all , my skin never feels oily or dry after this due to how i curated this exactly to my skin . 

BPO works great for me but can be annoyingly drying esp since i need a higher dosage , so i opted out of a cream/serum in place for the 10% BPO face wash . Salicylic also works great for me but again , hella drying , and dry skin for me leads to excess of oil . so it’s a toner with more glycolic than salicylic for a focus on texture , enough to exfoliate anything the wash missed while not necessarily being a leave on product to continue drying when i don’t need it . 

now snail mucin , it’s an odd one for me rn but it helps w my skins elasticity and creating a moisture barrier for the products i add on next since they’ve proven to be slightly irritating without it . 10% niacinamide serum for texture , so far this is the only serum i’ve found where it’s not mixed w BHA’s or AHA’s and is almost solely one thing . 

after that is my more active stuff . to replace a BPO cream i’ve opted into 0.1% adapolene and after an adjustment period i now use it morning and night . i pair that w 10% azelaic acid to combat more of that texture and pigmentation .

finally we’re nearing the end !! lock all those products in with a moisturizer that isn’t technically a moisturizer . cerave hyaluronic acid serum . cerave is great at making any product feel moisturizing but marketed moisturizers actually do too much for my face and don’t leave with the matte finish i enjoy . this helps my skin barrier after the medicated products without it being heavy . 

sunscreen ! i mix a few drops of vitamin c serum with my amazing sunscreen and boom i’m done ! this sunscreen is amazing if u struggle to find one that isn’t heavy and doesn’t leave ur face feeling oily , throughout the day it stays matte too . little to no white cast AND a new formula that makes it much easier to spread on the skin .",Skincare_Addiction

I've not been using the sulphur at all over the last week or so as was worried it was contributing to the dehydration, and opted for a gentle hydrating cleanser instead but this has made no difference to the oiliness, and lead to me actually waking up with about ten new spots each day, which is why l've restarted sulphur on non-tret nights.
Just looking for confirmation over whether this is a normal process and if I'm good to carry on? Has anyone else had issues with excessive oiliness when they started tret? How long did it last and was it worth it? It's so frustrating and I'm very close to giving up!",Skincare_Addiction

1710942373.0,Skincare Routine Advice and Dealing with Folliculitis After Shaving and in general (male),"Post:

Hello everyone,

I hope you’re all doing well. I’ve been adjusting my skincare routine over the past few months but unfortunately, I’m running into some issues, specifically with folliculitis after shaving. I wanted to share my current routine and the problem, hoping to get some advice or recommendations from the community.

Morning Routine:

	•	Shower (no specific skincare products in the morning)

Evening Routine:

	1.	Cleansing: I start with Balea Sensitive Wash Gel to clean my face.
	2.	Shaving:
	•	I use the One Blade razor. Before shaving, I wash my face with warm water and apply the Balea wash gel.
	•	Then, I use Nivea shaving foam (the white “Ice” version), let it sit for about 2 minutes, and use the shaving attachment as shown in the photo.
	•	After shaving, I rinse my face with cold water.
	3.	Aftercare:
	•	I apply zinc cream to some spots and use Avene Cicalfate to soothe the skin.

Problem: Despite this routine, I regularly develop folliculitis after shaving. I didn’t have issues with redness before using the One Blade razor, so I suspect it might be due to a dirty blade.

Has anyone had similar experiences or can offer tips on how to treat or avoid folliculitis? Are there any products or methods you can recommend to soothe the skin after shaving and prevent the formation of folliculitis?

I’m very grateful for any advice and recommendations!",Skincare_Addiction
1710931438.0,My Top 3 Cleansing Balms,"1. Farmacy Green Clean - Hands *down* the best cleaning balm as far as removing 100% of makeup/SPF/daily impurities, ease of use, overall experience it provides, quality, & results. The classic sorbet texture is really elevated, imo. It has a lovely, light citrus scent, & emulsifies incredibly easily with zero residue left behind. It’s also noncomedogenic (I’m SO happy it doesn’t contain Coconut Oil), & non-sensitizing (WHY do brands put things like menthol/eucalyptus in products that you are obviously going to be using on your eye-area????). If you’re looking for an everyday “get it done, but I still want to enjoy it” first cleanse, this is it. It really is such a fantastic + effective cleansing balm for all skin types!
*if this is out of your price range, the Elf Holy Hydration! Cleansing Balm makes an excellent, affordable dupe
**edit - Green Clean also comes in an Essential Oil/fragrance-free option called Clearly Clean, perfect for those who have sensitive skin/prefer to go without these ingredients; they have the exact same formula, with the same texture + results


2. Elemis Superfood Glow Cleansing Butter (previously called their Superfood AHA Glow Cleansing Butter //not reformulated//) - The most *luxurious* cleansing balm on the planet. It’s everything I wanted their ever-popular Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm to be, & more. The consistency is the epitome of decadent—buttery, & smooth—yet not overly heavy/greasy (like their Pro-Collagen is). It feels exactly like massaging softened butter on your face in the absolute best possible way. It emulsifies incredibly easily—leaving your skin feeling soft, supple, nourished, & clean. I LOVE the fact that it brightens the complexion without any added irritants, while also being noncomedogenic (unlike their Pro-Collagen, which contains both Coconut Oil, & ~475+ Essential Oils). While this cleansing balm does effectively remove all of my makeup (including eye makeup), I find it to be *way* too special to simply be used as a daily first-step makeup remover—though it can be used this way. I personally prefer to use it as something of a “treatment”/wash-off mask. I’ll take my sweet time working it into my skin, & then leave it on for 3-10+ minutes. I’m always blown away by the results! I *highly* recommend giving this cleansing balm a try if you’re looking for a real skincare treat for your “me time”.
*it’s easy to find this at a much more affordable price on sites like Mercari; Ipsy also often has it available in their shop at a deep discount


3. The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm - This is definitely the best affordable cleansing balm I’ve come across (though I’d pay way more for it if it had a high-end price tag). I put off trying it for SO long due to the mixed reviews. Well I can say with absolute certainty that I only agree with the positive ones. It’s become my N°1 favorite “in-shower” oil-based cleanser. I find it does an amazing job of preventing TEWL (Transepidermal Water Loss) for my face from the hot shower steam. I also loveeee the fact that the deliciously thick + nourishing formula never causes my dehydrated, combination-oily skin to breakout, while also rinsing easily + 100% clean (this is an issue I saw mentioned in some reviews, never once have I had this problem). It also removes my makeup SO WELL. Right on par with Green Clean! Something to note is that it does contain some gentle physical exfoliants. I believe it’s from the added oat kernel. I personally love the extra benefits it provides. The combination of the richer ingredients with the physical exfoliation makes for a really beautiful product—one that leaves my skin oh so soft + smooth, yet still lightly enveloped in nourishment. The squeeze tube format is also super convenient (I also appreciate the fact that I can give the tube a good shake before use, so I know all of the ingredients are properly incorporated with each other—this is another negative I came across in the reviews, & this easily solves the issue for me). A 5oz tube lasts for legitimately ages, making this my go-to for every shower. I find it so much easier to use in the shower than a traditional tub balm, so I never have to remove my makeup/wash my face separately in the sink beforehand (just be sure you adjust your water temp to mild/tepid before use). There really isn’t a downside to trying this cleansing balm. I’m over the moon I finally did, since I’m hooked for life. I often reach for it over my other 25+ oil-based cleansers. I definitely recommend giving it a try, especially if you’re the type to quickly blow through cleansing balms.
*I always double-cleanse with a water-based cleanser after using any oil-based cleanser



A few notes on some of the cleansing balms I *don’t* recommend -


Sephora Melting Cleansing Balm - This might be the worst cleansing balm I’ve ever tried in my life. Like I actually want to have an in-person conversation with any one of the people that posted a 5 star review on the Sephora app (there isn’t a ton, but there’s enough to make me question everything I know, & believe in). I’m the type to always gravitate towards unique textures in skincare. I LOVE trying them out—more lush + special the better. So when I saw the way this cleansing balm was described, & shown, I knew I had to try it. Oh man. It’s awful. Awful. While I know there is a time, & a place for non-emulsifying oil-based cleansers, this just takes it way too far. I’m left with what feels exactly like a surprisingly thick layer of greasy gunk all over my face, despite opting for the addition of a makeup cloth to remove it (my go-to will always be The Original Makeup Eraser, such a freaking game changer). It almost feels like I could still scrape it off with my finger nail after rinsing. On top of this, it doesn’t take off so much as a scrap of makeup. What the heck is in this stuff? You know how I mentioned The Inkey List‘s cleaning balm doesn’t feel too heavy, yet leaves my skin nourished? Well instead of that, this stuff has the exact same consistency as Vaseline. Now imagine trying to use that to remove your makeup. Then trying to scrub it off your delicate face. Re-freaking-diculous. This cleansing balm is only $12, so if you’re feeling incredibly brave/adventurous, you can easily give it a go. However, I hardcore recommend against it. The Inkey List’s is even less $ for way more! But hey, skincare is personal. You do you.


Clinique Take The Day Off Cleansing Balm - Unlike the Sephora cleansing balm, this one isn’t straight up trash. It just doesn’t deserve the hype it readily gets, imo. It’s the exact opposite of how I describe the elevated sorbet texture of Farmacy’s Green Clean. I find Clinique’s to be incredibly plain, boring, & honestly not the best for makeup removal. I expected this to be Top Tier when it comes to removing even the toughest/most stubborn makeup. So I was super disappointed when I struggled to remove so much as my non-waterproof mascara. I do see why it *used* to be known as the best—since it’s overall straight to the point + fragrance-free, & does eventually take off makeup with a little extra elbow grease. However, these days there are SO many better options out there. I just don’t understand why it’s still so dang hyped-up/popular. 



I hope this helps! Feel free to ask any questions on cleansing balms, or oil-based cleansers in general. I’ve tried practically every single one I’ve been able to get my hands on. And all the others I still have opinions on. 99% of them are on my wishlist, I’ll without a doubt get there eventually🫠",Skincare_Addiction

the one thing i really liked was the dewy skin moisturizer and cleanser i got a free sample of, it worked so amazing but i dont have that kind of money😭 any dupes?

i’ve tried so far:
-Almost all of the naturium line and ALL of them broke me out really really bad
-La Roche Posay, i’ve tried a couple if cleaners i forget which but they broke my face out really bad. Also tried the sunscreen moisturizer and it stung my face and left red welts
-Cosrx, i spent almost $100 on the snail mucin and blackhead products and they left me with severe cystic acne
-CeraVe SA cleanser & body wash, made my skin texture so fucking bad and gave me cystic acne on my back

currently using:
 gentle cetaphil cleanser and moisturizer and occasionally that honey halo farmacy moisturizer.

 I dont think the moisturizers are enough cause my skin is still very dry and flaky but they don’t break me out. The cetaphil and cerave cleansers only feel like my face is getting clean which is good but it doesn’t take care of my acne or dark spots.

I might stick to the cetaphil moisturizer and cleanser, but i need some recs to target my dark acne scars, redness, large pores and cheeks, very dry skin and blackheads on nose that are sensitive and acne prone friendly that wont break the bank. i just want my skin to glow, i’m pretty sure my barrier skin is so fucked up.

It's nothing dramatic, but I've noticed that the pores on my cheeks/nose have gotten bigger, and I usually have small bumps/blackhead-type zits on my forehead and chin that just keep popping up. That and the blind pimples. Man, I HATE those. They're huge and always leave a red welt/mark for WEEKS, and it's driving me crazy. 

I want to have a skincare routine because I'm pretty sure my current breakouts are basically down to me being...well....lazy and  also with extra stress in recent months it just exacerbates that and I think it would definitely help. I use a gentle facial scrub with Niacinamide like 2 times a week, but I'm convinced I might as well not bother if I don't have other skincare steps.

I take Zyrtec daily for my allergies. I use an eye cream at night (currently using It Cosmetics) and a “depuffing” cream before makeup during the day. 

I have the biggest bags that can’t be covered by makeup. The red dark circles can at least mostly be corrected w/ concealer but no matter how much concealer I wear I still look exhausted because of the bags that show through and are even more prominent.

1713039118.0,Wondering if this facial experience was normal?,"Hello! I tried out a new spa and I'm trying to figure out if I'm just being overdramatic or not. I normally get clear and brilliant laser somewhere else and had never had a traditional facial before.

When I signed up for the facial via class pass I received zero instructions and wasn't asked anything about my skin/history. The website of the spa doesn't say anything about preparing about this particular facial either. Since I didn't sign up for any peels or anything intense, but out of caution I stopped my tretinoin and my vitamin c about 3-4 days before to prevent excess irritation just in case. 

I walked into the spa room & was asked if I wanted champagne, and I said no because I don't really care for drinking, especially at 1 pm. **She kept asking me until I said yes.** She said that it was Saturday and that I should relax, which I get to an extent, but it was definitely weird. When she got it for me, she awkwardly stood there while I drank half of it and then I set it down.

Now, I have very clear skin that I've worked very hard towards and I definitely stare at it way too much, so I know where I have congestion, a few superficial whiteheads, and where I don't. I also know the difference between sebaceous filaments and blackheads, but it doesn't seem like this esthetician did. She worked with a very heavy grip on my face. It has been multiple hours since this facial and everywhere she worked is still very red and sore. My skin was mostly smooth and any congestion was not noticeable before walking into this spa. Now my face is very noticeably red and swollen and my nose is throbbing. The neck/shoulder massage was okay, but she massaged my face after the extractions, which hurt and all of the skincare she used really stung the open wounds on my face. She also left a clay mask on for so long that it dried out my skin and felt uncomfortable. Eventually, she washed if off, put on some serums that stung again, thanked me, and **told me not to wear sunscreen** after my facial. 

At the front counter she told me that my skin is too oily for moisturizer (I have dry skin) and that I should try this cleanser, which after looking at the ingredients is made out of **essential oils** and a $60 hyaluronic acid serum with no ingredient list. She also told me that she couldn't use vitamin c on my face today because I use prescription skincare (I use vitamin c every morning with no irritation while using tret) and that next time I should stop for two weeks beforehand, which doesn't make sense if I'm not doing anything other than steaming, extractions, and a face/head/neck massage.

I got home, and I looked in the mirror again and **I still have a few superficial whiteheads** after she squeezed my face so hard that its been hurting for multiple hours! Those should have been the easiest to get rid of. This spa has hundreds of five star reviews on class pass, yelp, and google. I did careful research beforehand and I feel like I accidentally went to an awful place by the same name. I can't tell if I'm being overdramatic or if I'm right to be disappointed. I gave her a full tip because I felt awkward doing anything less and didn't want to give class pass clients a bad rep for not tipping well. I was so excited for this and I'm trying not to be sad.",Skincare_Addiction

1712863448.0,Any advice is welcome,"About 6 years ago, I fell for this deal to get laser treatment done to my face.   I had a lot of issues related to health problems from previous years, and I was hoping that getting the laser would help... they made so many promises of the ""benefits"". 

 At the time, I was often mistaken for being honestly 20 years younger than I was.  It was nice, I still had the fullness in my face and literally no wrinkles.  

 I went in for my treatment, had numbed my face first, with numbing cream.   The person who did the laser treatment really turned up the heat.  It was heating the dermis and the subdermis, quite a lot.   Then as I'm leaving, they began to hard sell me for deals to pay for the next treatment.    That money is gone forever.

I went home, and didn't expect to anything but positive results.   Over the weeks and months, my face began to change in ways that horrified me.    I discovered the intense heat they had put into my face, had caused the death of the fat cells in my face - cell aptosis.   Suddenly, I just didn't even look like myself anymore.  And when I touched my face, all I felt was BONE, all over.  It was horrifying.  The skin became loose, and that looseness went South, into my neck.  The absolute worst.   Any expression I made would pile up skin, making rows of lines along the upper cheeks and on the forehead.  I always had a very smooth forehead with no expression lines, at least not horizontal ones.  

I suddenly had all this loose skin,  with nothing to support it anymore - major loss of volume.   That youthful look was definitely out the door.  

They also went really hard core over the corners of my mouth, so now there are divots there, and it makes it look like my mouth is drooping at the corners.   When I do my makeup, I have to do so much highlighting to try to balance out all of the hollowed out stuff.  

Yesterday, I saw a picture of me just before the treatment and then after, it was really interesting to see how small and angular my face had become.  

 I tried fillers, mainly so I could stand to look at myself.  I found them to be traumatic to get, and scary, because of the risks of losing your vision.  I just don't have any money for maintaining that.   You have to keep getting them, and over time they can really make your face start to get distorted.   I was told I needed fat transfer, but that costs thousands of dollars.  

I tried a variety of things, but over time my skin has developed a really pronounced, orange peel texture.  

I added a picture of just a small section of my cheek area.   

I was just wondering if anyone has any advice?  Something I can do that isn't expensive, but might improve the problem.    This isn't normal aging for me, it came on rapidly after that horrible laser treatment.  I have spoken to others online who had the same type of laser treatments, and the same type of results.  They were just as devastated as I was.  

Thank God I didn't go back for more treatments, they kept telling me I just needed to get more and it would look better.  Absolutely ridiculous.  I would have ended up looking like Skeletor.  

 If I had the money, I would honestly get a lower face/neck lift, but I will never be able to do that.  

 I currently have to wear a lot of sunblock if I go out, because I am a transplant patient.  Been doing that for many years, so I get minimal sun on my face.   I have done a lot of the common things you can do at home, like glycolic peels and microneedling, plus serums and such.    I haven't done a peel in a really long time. It's just kind of hard to affect something that goes so deep.   I also do facial exercise regularly, which helps a little bit.  ",Skincare_Addiction

Or is there any other better (effective) and more affordable alternative? I had an extensive (AM + PM) skincare routine about 1.5 years ago. My earlier routine included: 

AM : No cleanser(just cold water splashes), The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5, The Ordinary Glucoside solution 12%, La Roche-Posay Anthelios UVMUNE 400 Invisible Fluid SPF50, Cerave Moisturising Lotion.

PM : Cerave SA smoothing cleanser, Cerave hydrating toner, The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc 1%, The Ordinary Retinol 0.5% in squalane, alternating with Paula Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA liquid exfoliant every other day, Cerave moisturising lotion.

I am brown skin and I do pop my pimples but I still get left with a scar, blackheads on my nose and white heads on my chin, I also get black heads on my cheeks? not sure why.. maybe my mascara not properly washing off?

 toners, I just finished using the peach slices snail rescue blemishing toner and the exfoliant acne toner by peach slices. I wanted to switch it up and try something new today so I just purchased the Byoma brightening toner that has lactic acid, mandelic acid and barch extract as some of the ingredients. 

my serums are good molecules hyaluronic acid and good molecules niacinamide serum.

for exfoliants I purchased the Paulas choice BHA liquid 2% travel sized, my second night using it and I woke up with my skin feels soft. if all continues to go well I will def purchase the bigger size.

eye cream I use good molecules Yerba mate gel. 

moisturizer I use byoma moisturizing rich cream (im almost out so idk if I want to repurchase or try something new)

* Cerave PM facial lotion anytime (AM dries out my skin)
* Sunscreen (Neutrogena Clear Face) in AM if I'm going outside
* Argan oil at night for most of the past like 10 years

1712768441.0,Accutane + Tretinoin Success Story,"Hi everyone, success stories were my lifeline when my acne was at its worst, so I wanted to share mine. For context, I’m only wearing sunscreen in the first photo. 

I’ve struggled with severe acne for about 6 years, but experienced acne since the beginning of high school, until the end of my bachelors degree (so 8 years total). 

It’s been 2 years since I completed 9 months of Accutane which was a miracle for me. It drastically reduced the amount of new break outs I was getting. As far as clearing up acne goes, I give Accutane full credit because I was on Differin Gel for 8 months, then used Tretinoin for nearly 2 years prior to taking Accutane. I had also tried countless antibiotics, birth control pills, and facials in an effort to reduce my acne. Don’t get me wrong, Accutane is a hardcore drug that left my eyes insanely dry and itchy. My joints hurt to this day, but it was worth it. 

After Accutane, I still occasionally broke out and my face was covered in scars. I decided to give Tretinoin another try, but I heard that the cream may not be acne-prone friendly. Since I used Tretinoin before for a pretty extensive period of time, I was able to jump straight into daily use of 0.1% Retin-A Gel. 

To this day, I use a very similar nightly routine that I followed while on Accutane:
1. Albolene if I’m wearing eye makeup
2. Dove unscented beauty bar 
3. Tretinoin on damp skin (I know that many people find this very irritating but I love how easy it is to rub it in…)
4. For a while I used Cerave in the tub, but it just wasn’t moisturizing enough for me. I moved onto Vanicream, but it left my skin flaky in the mornings. Still less flaky than Cerave. I recommend Vanicream to anyone with active breakouts, because I currently use Nivea in the glass tub. In the past, I felt like it would break me out but right now it’s the only cost effective cream that leaves me glowy and dewy. I’m not encouraging anyone to use it, it just works for me.

In the mornings, I just slap on sunscreen. I don’t have a favorite yet but I really dislike any Cetaphil sunscreens. 

I hope to stick to this routine forever, because whenever I stray away from it and add another active, I wake up to 7 new breakouts instantly.",Skincare_Addiction
1712769341.0,micro needling ,"Hi all! I got the qure micro needling set up for some scarring and hyperpigmentation from my acne days as a teen. The scarring on my cheeks is the worst and the hyperpigmentation is on my cheeks and chin. I’m wondering about aftercare.

No wrinkles that I need help with yet maybe some darkness under my eyes but nothing too bad. Also my nose gets oily and between my eyebrows as well.

Due to all this I have experienced like a dent like a visible hollow not like the general hollow eyes but like a hole in which things can fit now like a drop of water can be held like a container .. not explaining properly but it is like that..
The doctor said that due to abuse with a lot of steroid tretinion etc creams the skin has dried out and no hydration etc and the rubbing has caused that hole or dent because of some fat pad has moved and the volume there is break down he said only option is filler cause laser will irritate and then mrf because of ice pick scars and overall texture brightening cause now there is no glow on face and has turned very dull and dark

I know 99% that I cannot reverse the the fat pad loss but does anyone know if it is possible naturally like any thing helps with this I really don't want to go the filler way but I am also depressed at how old this makes me look

(the green one) for 6 month now, and it hasn't done anything for my face while washing w it my face stings and my cheeks turn red and my face still feels tight & itchy afterwards.

So I've been thinking of switching my cleanser to something else but I'm very sceptical of what to buy. I've been thinking of buying either the 'toleriane hydrating gentle cleanser' or 'lipikar syndet AP+' from la roche posay.

So please tell me if either of these r good and which one is better, and if u have any other better suggestion.

1712612074.0,Should I start using retinol at the age of 21?,"I’ve noticed so many people online being very biased about retinol but I’m uncertain if I should start using it. I'm 21 years old with normal, occasionally dry skin, and I don't have any acne, redness, or bumps. However, I do have smile lines, quite prominent forehead wrinkles, pigmentation (especially dark circles under my eyes), and overall my skin looks a bit dull. I've considered retinol as a potential solution to brighten my skin, but I'm a little worried about experiencing retinol purging or damaging my skin. I bought L'Oreal Revitalift Laser 0.2% pure retinol, but I'm unsure if that's the right percentage for a beginner. 

Do you believe retinol is necessary for someone my age with no significant skin issues? Should I proceed with using it, or would you recommend alternative products for brightening my skin?",Skincare_Addiction

1712606195.0,What is the best SPF 100 ?,"Before the “you don’t need spf 100” people come for me, I need to explain my situation. So I’m extremely fair skinned, to the point where if my arm is exposed in the car for 5 minutes I’m going to get burned. I’m going through a lot of health issues at the moment and one of my treatments is a medication I have to take for the next 3 months, the doctors have warned me that the biggest side effect is severe sunburns if my skin is exposed to sunlight. I’m at a bigger risk considering my skin is already super sensitive and I have to work outside a lot. 

My current spf I use is 50 (face and my body) but I feel that isn’t enough. I’ll give a brief rundown of my skincare in case any recommendations might do more damage than harm. I can’t have any fragrances and my skincare routine works great for me so I just want something I can use to replace my Coola for the time being. I have a mix of dry and oily skin depending on the season.

Any advice on facial or body sunscreens would be much appreciated as I start this medication in a week and want to be prepared. I’m following all the doctors’ directions with staying shaded and cool I just need a super strong sunscreen higher than 50 spf that can get me through work

Re-added these to my cart. The rosemary shampoo is out of stock now and got the nest perfume delivered to my brother’s house in US. I have a hobby/fixation with collecting perfumes like pokemon :’) hoping the nest are decent? got them around 27 CAD/21 USD, the rosemary shampoo for like 30CAD (without 15% tax 😔)

I’ll split the Dr. Dennis with my 66 year old mother, I really want to boost her confidence and self esteem 🥺 also thinking of cutting them even further in half (or 4 pieces?) and placing them in air tight containers so they’d last longer. Although I’m worried they will dry out significantly/not be as effective as told by a sephora employee. They are quite expensive but seem to work wonders on me and I’m hopeful they’ll help her 🥺 i also got them cuz they seem to have everything? Like i don’t need to buy additional serum/retinol/acids and stuff, wondering if that makes it more cost effective in the long run? got her the bioderma blue retinol day/night cream set from shoppers as well but couldn’t give yet since she lives on the other side of the world..i want to spoil my mom but hopefully I can do more when my income increases 😔

Got the necessaire deo to lighten my dark underarms, would have preferred unscented but it’s completely out of stock. Was considering getting the cheaper ordinary glycolic acid but was wondering if it’d be harsher compared to this? Im also currently doing laser hair removal treatment for my PCOS. Got the spf lip balm to help with my pigmented lips too. I already use laneige lip mask and sugar scrub but see no difference :(

Got the necessaire rosemary shampoo set cuz I have very less hair :( my braids and pony tails look so pathetic, thinner than a horse tail. Got the white one too as a clarifying shampoo although considering returning if they are too similar. Was hoping to get a gentle shampoo that wont dry my hair out too much and help with my hair loss. I had been using the bondiboost rosemary thinning set and they seem much oilier (?) but not sure how effective they’ve been so far🧍🏻‍♀️tbh im wondering how significantly different they are from cheaper drugstore shampoos and if I can just cut down my costs if i get no silicone/sulphate ones. Any cheaper alternative for hairloss would be much appreciated!

The lip liner and eye glitter are my very first, wanted to go with ‘universal’ colors so I never have to buy another again. Getting the lip liner as a natural color since my lipstick always looks like it goes outside 😶‍🌫️ The eye glitter is purely for my brother’s wedding.

Will use the clay mask once a week to help with my blackheads/Sebaceous filaments. I have the Kate Somerville sulphuric wash but want to use it infrequently cuz its pretty costly and always out of stock lol.

Feel lukewarm about the tarte lip balm, was wondering if I could just use burt bees transparent lip balm and lipstick instead. Got the body wash since I liked the smell in store. Never used a sol janero product in my life but hoping it’s moisturizing cuz i struggle with very dry skin.

Apologies for the essay :’( I’m still quite a noob with self grooming/skincare/makeup despite being 25.

1712580392.0,Am i missing something!?,"

Hello everyone,   

35 M   

In the last three weeks, I've been taking care of my facial skin  again, so I did some research and watched some videos/feedbacks/youtube  etc.   

But since I started using these products, something is different, on  the negative side. Because I notice that I have a lot more acne, small  red spots, and whiteheads in the nose area, and two of them haven't gone  away (left marks, didn't squeeze) even after two weeks.   

I have the feeling that the Cerave lotion (Blue package) is not  working very well for me, probably I need to use a moisturizer that is  for combination skin (dry and oily in the T-zone).   

I also noticed that my dark circles are much worse (I use all the  products in the eye area), I would also like you to help me indicate a  good product for dark circles, and I don't rule out makeup, but it  should be something very discreet.   

After waking up:   

&#x200B;

* Cerave hydrating cleanser     
 
* Shave     
 
* Uriage - thermal water     
 
* Nivea super sensitive skin after shave     
 
* Cerave hydrating lotion     
 
* Korean SPF50 sunscreen or Australian Gold mineral SPF 50+     
 
* Vaseline Lip therapy.

In the past six months I’ve noticed a ton more hyperpigmentation/“age spots,” & weird orange peel texture which I wasn’t having issues with before.

Right now I’m using the ordinary niacinamide & hyaluronic acid at night, a vitamin c serum & sunscreen during the day, and a retinol cream 3-4x a week at night. Also use an Aesop face oil for moisturizer. I live in the deep south so don’t struggle too much with dry skin. Definitely need to up my water intake as I’ve been slacking on that, though.

Other possible factors; I went back on the pill in January. I eat relatively healthily & don’t drink alcohol or smoke, but I could stand to cut down on sugar & caffeine.

I was kinda taken aback with the roller as I know it's not really a good idea to use it especially with actives that can irritate skin and also knowing him he probably doesn't wash his face before.

I asked him if he knows that the roller can spread bacteria around his whole face if he doesn't wash his face and the roller properly beforehand. He said that I am a silly goose for thinking he is not prepared, because before he rolls his face he uses propylalcohol to spray his face down and the roller.

I was shocked at that. 

Honestly I am not very good at giving reasons why what he is doing is extremely irritable to his skin (not really sure how he has not broke out like crazy, my man's having better skin than me). I told him that the minoxidil is irritant on its own, couples with a 3% retinol is vile and that the straight up alcohol is going to dry him out. He's been doing this for months now. To be fair, he does this roller thing every 3 days, not everyday.

Can someone please give me an explanation of why what he is doing is dangerous so I can properly educate him on this? And or maybe if this is actually good, how? How come I spend hundreds of dollars and hours watching skincare advice, having a solid morning and evening routine and still have worse skin than this man?",Skincare_Addiction

Just plain old medicine and simple skin care. About 4 months ago, I signed up for an online dermatology service. They gave me 3 months of doxycycline and a clyndamycin+benzoyl peroxide topical treatment. I paired these with sunscreen and an unscented, noncomedogenic moisturizer.  I also used a tranexamic acid serum in the mornings. After I completed the doxycycline and clyndamycin, I was prescribed a tretinoin+spironolactone+tranexamic acid topical treatment. Here is my current routine:
A.M.: Splash face with water, apply sunscreen and moisturizer,  
P.m.: Wipe off dirt and grime with cold cream and warm washcloth, apply 5% benzoyl peroxide cream and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes, wash face with unscented face wash, moisturize, apply half pump of prescription cream.

I loved the  smell too much though as it was the buttery sort of vanilla and it was a comforting scent for me overall, so I did the thing where i put it in hot water for a few minutes to fix the graininess. It fixed the issue in the first tube and I went thru it. Its alright overall. Now as for the seconf tube, I put it in hot water, same thing, same time and when i come back to check on it the product was spilled out into the water.

 I panicked and I tried cleaning off the tube on the outside because now it was super sticky. Again tried soap and it was still sticky and made my hands super sticky. I applied it then next day only to find that the formula literally separated. Im literally so fucking disappointed rn. I paid alot to get my hands on one because Rhode isnt available where im from and honestly I really liked the scent and wanted it to work but now im just so over it. Never buying this again.

I thought with it being basically 7 years that the scarring would’ve cleared but it hasn’t. The scarring is mostly redness, almost looks like clusters of flat pimples but it’s not. Every time I get a breakout whether it be my forehead, cheeks, chin it always leaves a mark that doesn’t fade. I’ve tried so many skin care products over the years & nothing has helped, so I’m kinda at a loss. My goal is to have an even skin tone without all these blemishes.  My skin is a light-medium olive tone, which is darker in summer so I think that doesn’t help with the scarring. Any recommendations or tips please? Thank you :)

Im 28 years old and did not take care of my face, like, ever, before now. I washed my makeup (i use only eyebrow gel) but did nothing more for years, and had no problems with my face. Now i have been including daily skincare to my selfcare routine, but after a couple of months of using my products, i think my skin is only getting worse. Some days my cheeks are red, i think im getting more pimples than i used to and most of all i think the skin on my face is not as even as it used to be.. (I have been doing my evening routine for about 4 months now, morning routine for over a month - products below)

I have similar, bad skincare experience with my hands too. I have started using hand lotion before going to bed, just to add some extra to my evening routine. There was nothing wrong with my hands, they were not dry or anything BUT after using lotion daily, they have become very dry, and making my skin break more easily. The skin on my hands just feels weird after using lotions. 

Whats the point of this all if it only makes my skin worse? Is it really just the whole fkng industry that makes our skin addicted to the products, to make us buy even more, or are my products just not suitable for my skin? And if that is so, what should i change/take off, where should i start? Or should i just quit?

I had a rush of acne that appeared slowly, since the summer, bit by bit, it was gaining territory in my cheek lmao, and after trying with salicylic acid and it not working, this has made my bumps slowly disappear and the inflammation go away for the most of it. 

I’m not asking for recommendations, just your opinion on the active! Left to say, I know if this doesn’t work I’ll have to visit a dermatologist, so dw!",Skincare_Addiction

1712393109.0,"We should normalize textured skin aka acne pitted scars, large pores etc.....stop seeing textured skin as something to be ashamed off and treating it like critical handicap that have to be cured, removed or hidden","I am in my 40s and have both large pores and pitted scars from acne(basically textured skin). I have thyroid issues before this and I have uterus fibroid removed like 5 years ago. I do not fit into the typical mold of beauty where women have long tresses of hair, smooth and flawless skin and typical petite size. I was the opposite of almost everything in the mold. I used to feel sad when I see someone else with smoother and flawless skin and thought why I can't be like them. I have also received the unkind remarks from ignorant people commenting that I am not pretty and my skin not porcelain smooth. I used to feel so small.

I have tried every remedy for my large pores and pitted scars, but none of them seems to have long lasting effect. I lived in Asia Pacific, the pressure to have a flawless and smooth skin is so immense, every time I scroll through social media, 99.99% its either about the glass skin or some post saying who and who(maybe celebrities, influencer or some girls who just keep posting about themselves on social media) have flawless and smooth skin. 

And then one day I thought why am I giving so much f\*ck on all this kind of thing, I am living the best time of my life now. I am grateful I managed to overcome my thyroid issue and learn new thing in life. During these few years I realize its a blessing for other people to see that my skin is actually textured because that is who I am. I am not alone with textured skin and I don't think it will define who I am. ",Skincare_Addiction

1712359303.0,Which one: Glow Recipe Niacinamide Dew Drops or Good Molecules Discoloration Correcting Serum,"Hi All!

I'm pretty new to skincare as a whole and have been working on learning ingredients and getting the specific brands/serums for the results I want. My routine is pretty simple and I am trying to find a niacinamide serum to settle on. 

I like the consistency and feel of both the Glow Recipe Niacinamide Dew Drops and the Good Molecules Discoloration Correcting Serum. I've been using the Good Molecules serum for the last month and like the results so far. But I wanted to branch out into different brands. Since I don't like layering serums, I've been sticking to a niacinamide one as my main serum, but which works better? I tried to look at the ingredients, but I only understand what they are and not how the amounts of them are factoring into my product. 

Which one would help most with my goal of evening out my skin tone and getting rid of dark spots? Any advice would be great in helping me pick between them. Thanks!

1712278162.0,Microneedling scarred my skin,"I have no reason to write this post but to inform anyone who's considering it to think carefully before jumping onto the microneedling bandwagon.

I got my 1st (and only) session done 2 months ago per my dermatologist's suggestion as a solution to slightly enlarged pores on my cheeks. My session was fairly light, I didn't feel much pain and the recovery entailed no peeling or any major redness. I didn't suffer throughout the process and was actually excited about the potential results.

Fast forward to a few weeks post-procedure, I notice a skin-colored formless bump (only lightly raised) on my nose. It was like a little flesh-colored flattened island. 

Then, I decided to shine a flashlight across my face to create some shadows and investigate that bump further, when I suddenly found track grooves all across my face: cheeks, temples, chin. I also noticed other ""flattened islands"" on my cheeks. 

The skin was scarred and worse off then when I started. I'm devastated. You can't see it much if you're not increasing the lighting contrast around my face with a flashlight, but it's enough for me to realize that it's caused some damage to fairly healthy, young (33 y/o) skin.

I have an appt with the dermatologist soon and will keep you posted on what to expect from now on.

If anybody else has experienced the same, I'd love to know and feel less alone in this. It's really been affecting my self esteem.

Tldr: got 1 micro-needling session done and regret it immensely

Edit: The procedure was done 2 months ago, not 4 as I previously thought (just revisited my phone pics for accurate timing)

—

UPDATE (10 MONTHS):

There is DEFINITELY light at the end of the tunnel! 
*you can find photos of my original issue in a comment below*

A little context: For months after that procedure, I began getting a crazy amount of acne. I was used to getting the usual pre-period pimples that were cystic, hurt a lot but never really surfaced, but these were more aggressive and much more spread out. I'd have at least 4-5 active pimples constantly (which was not the case before microneedling) and they'd show up on random places like my forehead (which was random for my usual pimple experience).

I started treating the pimples and in the process, I feel like I exfoliated my skin enough over time that the texture seems MUCH better now 10 months later. It's a slow process but hang in there! 

My routine included an acne soap that contained zinc, benzoyl peroxide 10% (I can handle this well) and azelaic acid at night (which is the most underrated acid in the universe imo). I didn't use the azelaic acid every night—I kept it to ~3x a week.
For sun protection, I relied a lot on my heavy duty hats because my skin was sensitive. I stayed indoors a lot so I didn't always lather in sunscreen but I absolutely always wore a hat when outside.

My texture improved over time but if you're being sold on more microneedling so you can ""see improvement after more sessions,"" I would highly encourage you to think twice in case you already had a bad reaction to the first session like I did. 

Hope this helps!",Skincare_Addiction

1712262616.0,Have You Given Up on the Skincare Industry? I Have.. Kinda,"I’m in my 30’s and I have dry skin which has led me to spending a good amount of money the last three years buying different types of moisturizers, cleansers, serums and more to benefit my skin. I’ve also dabbled in buying several collagen and peptide products because they claim to make a difference and prevent/repair age lines etc. 

I don’t really have any major skin concerns other than maintaining moisture, but I used to look for things that claim to prevent aging because I didn’t feel it would hurt to take preventative measures.

Now that I’ve done research on ingredients, I’ve cut down on spending and minimized my skincare routine to 5 things:

1. Castile bar soap
2. Exfoliating glove
3. Jojoba oil
4. Sweet Almond oil… may switch to Apricot 
5. Either the Weleda Baby Cream or the Palmers Vitamin E Concentrate Skin Barrier Repair Moisturizer.

I don’t wash my skin everyday to prevent excessive dryness. When I moisturize my face I dampen my skin with water and massage 1 or 2 oils on my face, neck and chest. I make sure to spend a minute or two gently massaging the under eye area, smile line area and my forehead to let the oils get deeper into the skin. 
If don’t use oils and need to use a cream to avoid the excessive shine the oils create, I’ll use one of the moisturizers that I mentioned.

I no longer spend money on anything that claims to be a “miracle repair” product or markets themselves as “anti-aging”, contain to have peptides/collagen etc. I don’t but exfoliating products because an exfoliating glove lasts longer and can be purchased in bulk, which I have done.

Jojoba oil has many benefits for the skin since it contains Ceramides and is very similar to the skins sebum. It also absorbs easily and is practically free of any scent. There are also other oils that can even benefit **OILY skin** as well, like *dry oils*.

DON’T LET THESE SKINCARE BRANDS FOOL YOU WITH THEIR FALSE PROMISES AND MARKETING SCHEMES. Yes, some brands offer great products but many are just cash grabs. 


Please research the ingredients in the products you use and the benefits of natural ingredients like carrier oils.

1712259921.0,Need help with routine,"Hi all! I'm looking for guidance and advice on my current skincare routine. I'm 30 years old for context. 

I'm mostly worried I might be ""overdoing"" it with too many products and damaging my skin barrier.

My main concerns in the last few months are that I frequently am getting small red spots and small whiteheads every morning on my nose and cheeks. I also am noticing some darker spots on my cheeks that I'm worried is sun damage from when I was younger. See photos. Ignore my bloodshot eyes, I just put in contacts and they irrated my eyes lol.

also, I know my skin isn't ""bad"" especially as compared to when I was younger. I just want to make sure I'm using the best products I can for my type of skin.

I have combination skin that tends to lean more oily.

Here's the routine I've been on. Everything is stuff I've been using for 6 months to a year, except the vitamin c which is new in the last 3 months.

I'd love any advice or thoughts on whether my skincare routine is ok or if there's stuff I need to stop using.

My routine: 
AM
-aveeno clear complexion foaming cleanser
-cerave hydrating Toner
-Versed just breathe clarifying serum
-Derma-e vitamin c concentrated serum
-Asterwood Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum
-Cetaphil daily facial moisturizer with spf 15
-if I'm spending time in the sun I also add glossier invisible shield sunscreen on top

PM 
-aveeno calm and restore oat cleanser
-cerave hydrating Toner
-cerave resurfacing retinol serum
-la roche posay double repair moisturizer
-sometimes I add Prima night magic facial oil and slug with aquaphor on top.

So, any thoughts? I am wondering if I should drop the vitamin c serum? I've always had random white heads and red spots, but I do think they've gotten a bit worse in the last 3 months which coincides with starting the vit c. Maybe I'm just using too many things?",Skincare_Addiction

So i started developing these really weird tiny bumps all over my skin about 5 months ago - i’ve tried nizarol to get rid of them but that hasn’t been successful. my skin is super dry and sensitive. my current routine is:

PM:
- etude whip cleanser 
- purito centella unscented toner 
- on week 3 of medik 8 crystal retinal so have just started applying every other day 
- curel intense moisturiser 

I am really struggling at the moment trying to find a way to get rid of them  as they’ve been on my skin for so long! i also just want to add in wearing a very light weight skin tint (glossier) in these photos which if anything have made the bumps more visible. it’s really weird because they don’t feel bumpy and at just under my skin. i started using retinal as read online this was really good for increasing cell turnover. About a month ago i stopped using paula’s choice BHA as it wasn’t doing anything for my skin and i thought these bumps may be from a compromised skin barrier so really simplified my skincare routine. however it’s been over a month now and they still seem to be there. 

anything to suggest what i should start using or to just stick it out with my retinal?

1712145142.0,[routine help] the bane of my forehead,"

Hey! 
So my skin has always been weird in that whenever I do nothing to it it looks great (and I mean nothing)- no breakouts or spots, maybe some bumps under my eyes that I think are called millia? But the second I try a skincare routine, even if it’s nothing but wetting my face and then putting moisturiser on, it all goes to hell. When that happens I stop using anything until it goes back to normal…and then I tend to try again cause I don’t want the products to go to waste (dumb I know)

Sometime last year I tried again and used an expired (I didn’t notice at the time) vitamin C serum that I think caused this nasty reaction on my forehead. I got these little bumps/rash that itches like crazy and then got crusty/scabby and itched more. In the end I cut some bangs so I wouldn’t see it and stop picking at it. It cleared up to the point that it’s not itchy anymore, BUT it is VERY dry and flaky and will react negatively to anything other than Vaseline. I also have dry patches like that on an eye lid? 

Me being a dumbass, did a face mask (made of rice idk it was sticky) last night and now it’s back to being red. Not itching or dry and flaky, just red and raised, and I figured I could ask and see if anyone knows wtf it is or how to get rid of it. I do plan to see a dermatologist at some point but it just hasn’t been possible yet.

Hope this makes sense and would really appreciate any advice!!

Using these serums has helped me alot. Even now I don't seem to have a significant reaction on my skin other than occasional one pimple once in 2 months due to heat or periods.

I really don't know if using these two serums together will have long term effects. So please help me with the topic. Thank you.

1712073533.0,2 things to consider when choosing a dermatology in Korea,"I’m a local Korean 
Went to over 20 different clinics probably closer to 40 (consultations and medications included) to treat acne, acne scars, pigments, enlarged pores. I probably had procedures done at about 10 different clinics. 

I would like to share a bit of my personal experience after spending thousands of dollars  on so many different clinics to treat my acne prone skin and pigments. But keep in mind that this is just from my personal experience, but also… these are just really basic things all Korean locals would consider before choosing a dermatology but I noticed that most foreigners don’t … 

1. Make sure the dermatology has board certified dermatologists
 - This is probably the most basic & important thing to consider because getting your skin treated at a “dermatology” without board certified dermatologists is just like getting plastic surgery from a family physician or a doctor who isn’t a specialist in plastic surgery or going to a gynecology run by a non board certified dermatologist.
- I realized this after seeing less improvements, getting deeper scarring and receiving risky acne prescriptions from NON board certified dermatologies

2. Check the kind of laser machine they have (this is the SECOND most important thing not the first)
You need to make sure that the dermatology machines are being used by someone who specializes in dermatology!!!

 Face Reality helped clear my skin but I’m open to trying other brands. I’ve been considering Dr. Gross peel pads because I’ve seen great things on TikTok.

1712059054.0,routine/order help please?,"hi everyone, i am trying to establish a skincare routine. i am 27f and have these Ordinary products pictured. i also use Bubble Cloud Surf moisturizer and Supergoop Play sunscreen.

 currently i feel like i kind of use the ordinary products at random times and could benefit from structure and knowing when to apply which product, AM/PM etc. 

i know some say “before heavier creams” and the retinol for example says “after water based treatments” but i am not familiar enough with skincare to know which of these go before which.

 if someone could please help me by letting me know the order i should apply (for morning & night) i would be very grateful. thank you so much! 

p.s. also open to suggestions if there are any key products i’m missing! again i’m 27f, my main concerns are fine lines (forehead/11’s mostly), eye bags, moisture & overall glow/skin health :) ",Skincare_Addiction

6. Dear Klairs Rich Moist Soothing Cream

I have dry to normal skin with little bumps all over my skin but it’s not noticeable only when i run my fingers thru it i feel it. 

So when i was 19/20 i used to use retinol, niacinamide, salicylic acid, moisturiser at night and vitamin C in the morning with sunscreen. I know i was really stupid and that probably would’ve caused my skin a lot of damage but my skin was doing fine. 

I stopped after i turned 21 and my basic routine became really simple sunscreen in the morning and moisturiser at night. When i turned 22 i was scared of pre mature ageing because i was getting slight bags/wrinkle under my eyes a few months back i tried retinol again but again i stopped using it. 


My current routine is. 

Morning- double cleansing with a basic foaming cleanser and cerave hydrating cleanser and then biore sunscreen (the japanese one) 
Night - double cleanse again with the same cleanser and cerave moisturising lotion

Now i really want to get back into using serums and i want to do it right. I want to use one serum and one only. It’s either niacinamide or retinol. Please help me which should i pick and what should i do. I’m 22 right now i will turn 23 in two months, is it too early for me to start retinol (even thought i did it stupidly without any knowledge) or should i stick to niacinamide for a while till im old enough to use retinol

(before/after photos),"Hey all, I’ve worked for 10+ years trying to clear my acne (and have been extremely successful at times), but if there is ONE thing in the ENTIRE world that I wish someone had explained to me sooner, is that skincare will NOT fix hormonal acne!

I’ve been seeing so many women lately with acne that is VERY clearly hormonal and they are sooo frustrated (understandably), but they’re also frustrated that new skincare isn’t working or they think that a previous product in their routine was responsible for breaking them out. This is not what’s happening! Hormonal acne is internal and it will never ever ever get fixed with skincare alone. (Not even Tretinoin)

The pictures were taken 4 months apart, and I did not ever change ONE single thing about my skincare routine. I cleared it up by treating the issue internally. I took supplements to help balance my hormones (just regular vitamins and teas). I didn’t even have to cut out dairy or any of those typical things people recommend. My hormones had just gotten a little out of whack and I was producing too many androgens. You can absolutely 10000% get rid of hormonal acne, but try to focus on balancing yourself from the inside first.",Skincare_Addiction

I know so many people are using filters, fillers, and Botox and all that these days but I feel like my skin shouldn’t look this bad at 29. My pores are very large, I have fine wrinkles on my forehead, really bad eye bags and excess skin and wrinkles around my eyes and then I feel like the my nasolabial folds and between my eyes are starting to look noticeably saggy or like I’m getting early jowls.

My current routine - 

Morning: wash my face with water, then vit c with hylauronic acid, face massage corsx all in one cream, and then I’ll try to remember sunscreen before applying makeup but I have 3 young kids so my days and especially mornings are hectic so I have very little time for myself and don’t get ready most days 

Night: double cleanse and pat dry, alternate nights with retinol, hylauronic acid, face massage with more corsx all in one cream, an eye cream, and then moisturizer. 

Once or twice a month I’ll try to remember to do a charcoal mask and dermaplane with a sterile disposable scalpel.

Update on update post lol: Mods locked the update post for....some reason so ig I'll just post what I said here:

Hey everyone,

So my post got a lot more attention than I expected lol

I'm very thankful for the all the responses but, If I'm completely honest, I'm quite a bit overwhelmed with all the suggestions. There's a lot of people asking me to try a lot of different things and I simply do not have the time or money to try everything :(

To answer a few of the common suggestions:

1.Isotretinoin/spironolactone:  Unfortunately, I am not able to go on isotretinoin/accutane at the present time. I am moving around too much to get the required monthly testing done. I also am currently dealing with more prioritized health issues (both mental and physical) and I believe that the effects of isotretinoin would exacerbate the negative effects of these issues and interrupt their treatment.

I actually had a previous derm recommend spiro but he told me that I would need to be constantly monitored for low blood pressure and 1. that is very scary and 2. it goes back to my first point.

(I'm ngl the people talking about possible nerve damage + heart palpitations from spiro also scares me, the known side effects of isotret also really scare me, hence me not doing either to this day)

2.Spearmint/Mint/Green tea: I actually haven't had spearmint tea before. It sounds like a great option but, unfortunately, it has tannins which would limit the absorption of my current required supplements. 

I have regularly drank matcha in the past, I don't think it really had an impact on my acne, though.

3.Seeking medical help/dermatologist: I have seen 4 dermatologists in the past. One gave me a bunch of topicals and niacin, no big changes. Another put me on Epiduo, no big changes. The last put me on an antibiotic I no longer remember and that was probably the clearest skin I've ever had. Unfortunately, I couldn't be on it long term and it all came back as soon as I went off it :')

That last one was the one who recommended spiro. 

I haven't gone back to a dermatologist cause I can't really afford it anymore and I just got tired of not getting results. I wasn't ready for spiro or isotret so I just stopped.

4.Blood work for hormone checking/allergies: I have never had blood work done for hormones, I'm not really sure what that means. I'm not really sure how I would go about that and what that'd mean for my skin.

I have had blood work done for allergens, no identified major allergies except moderate dust allergy. 

5.Stress: Unfortunately, I think my life is just gonna be pretty stressful for a while lol. I don't come from a wealthy family and I have a pretty useless degree (+ a plethora of other problems) so my life is just kinda composed of stress atm. 

6.Diet: Oh boy. So, I feel I do my best to eat as healthy as I can. I make an effort to eat vegetables every day and fruit when I can. I drink pretty much only water. I make sure I stay at or under the recommended daily values for sodium and added sugar. I avoid dairy and meat as much as I can. I've made an effort to increase my olive oil/avocado intake. 

A lot of people are saying to cut sugar entirely. I'm sorry but I simply can't do that. Idk if you saw it in my post but I avoid A LOT of things: alcohol, drugs, meat, dairy. Sugar is the one thing I have left that makes eating enjoyable. I do make an effort to not go above 25 mg of added sugar a day. I just can't give it up entirely, I really don't have much to look forward to each day with how my life is going rn and it's my one little guilty pleasure I can have to brighten the day up a bit.

7.Zinc: I HAVE done a zinc soap before, I don't think it really made much of a difference. Maybe I should look into a zinc supplement, I would need to check interactions with my current supplements, though. 

8.Fibroids: I've had x-rays done in my pelvic area and have never heard anything about these. Maybe they're only detectable w other imaging? I don't think I could afford a CAT or MRI scan rn :(

9.Birth Control: I have thought many, MANY times about going on birth control. My family has a really bad history with birth control, specifically the pill. I've thought about an IUD but haven't heard anything about it clearing acne. Idk I've just heard so many traumatic things about birth control from the people around me and I've just been really hesitant to get on it (don't worry, I've never been sexually active). I also heard your acne just comes back  x10 once you get off.

10.Hair products: I literally don't use anything in my hair lmao, I use hairspray VERY rarely. I do have oily ass hair that may cause some of my forehead acne but I cannot control that unless I just go bald.

11.Pregnancy: I know this isn't really a suggestion but I also don't really plan on having kids for a multitude of reasons soooo I don't even have that to look forward to 😭

12.Fungal: I'm pretty sure I was told my acne was not fungal at some point by a derm. I def believe it is hormonal, idk I could be wrong, maybe fungal acne can be hormonal?


There's quite a few people who asked for my skin type/products so here ya go:

My skin type: OILYYY and SENSITIVEEEE holy shit I don't know anyone with more sensitive skin than me 

My products:
I only rinse with water and then moisturize  (Cerave Moisturizing Cream (yes, I know this is a controversial one!! unfortunately, I HAVE to buy it anyways for my eczema (nothing else works) and I don't really have the budget to be buying two moisturizers rn) + spf (physical zinc sunscreen) in the morning. 

Evening:
Salicylic Acid Cleanser (I leave it on for like 5 min before rinsing)

1694105731.0,I went two weeks without deodorant & this is what happened:,"Edit: So weird how you can explain how something is working for you and people will *still* be recommending products 😅. I appreciate it everyone, I know you’re just trying to help but I’m good right now lmao. I’ve tried 99% of the products y’all are suggesting anyways. 

The only thing I did was wash in the shower, and apply The ordinary’s glycolic acid toner to my armpits about twice a day. Either with my hands or a cotton pad. 

The pros: 

Didn’t smell at all, had multiple people check for me. Smelled like absolutely nothing

My pits didn’t feel goopy or slimy or sticky or crusty. I find that deodorant always clumps up on me and gets gross, especially if I have a bit of hair. 

No aluminum! 

No ingrown hairs and I got a cleaner shave because there was less dead skin 

I felt extremely clean 

My armpits weren’t as itchy, which is why I did this experiment in the first place, I felt like I was always having a reaction to the chemicals in normal deodorants and antiperspirants. 

Super cheap! 

I felt like I sweat less 

The cons:

Didn’t have that extra boost of nice floral smell whenever i’d move my arms

That’s it 

Will I go back to wearing deodorant? If I can find like a gel based one that that dries down and doesn’t have aluminum, maybe, just for the nice smell, but overall I don’t think I will be purchasing traditional deodorant or antiperspirant ever again. I want like a natural armpit perfume or something. Something in deodorants/antiperspirants make my armpits super itchy and bumpy so this is a great revelation for me. plus I just don’t love wearing them 

Why does this work? The stuff that actually makes us smell isn’t our sweat. if that was the case, our whole body would stink all the time. The thing that actually makes us smell is the bacteria that interacts with the sweat. The bacteria thrives in warm, moist environments which is why the things that usually stink are genitals, armpits, and feet. These stinky bacteria can only thrive if the skin’s pH is 5.5-6.5. Glycolic acid’s pH is anywhere from 0.08-2.75 which is much more acidic than our armpit’s natural climate. Therefore, the bacteria can’t survive, and the stink cannot thrive.",Skincare_Addiction

I have clear skin and unlined at 48 years old. I am adding a pic with no make up. I rarely wear makeup because I think it’s important to let your skin breathe.
My routine is: clean face at night with cold cream. I let it sit on my face around a minute then use a hot wash cloth to wipe it off. I may or may not use a night cream depending of it my skin has felt dry. In the morning I wipe down my face with a clean, cool washcloth and might add day cream or a sunblock. I have been skipping it lately because I’m rarely out in the sun and I hate the way it feels on my face.
My favorites are: ponds cold cream and the skin cream you get at aldis….lacura brand day cream and night cream. 
Anyone else use these? They are great quality and super cheap. Around $4 each. I could use whatever I want but choose these due to how great they are. At least for me. I know everyone’s skin is different.

I was wondering if it was the products I was using or if it was because I was just overusing said products.,My daily and nightly routine used to be practically the same the only thing different was the oil cleanser. I used to put the toner on mornings and nights as well as the exfoliate but I would use it less often. My skin would get super dry and irritated and anything I put on would burn. I changed up my routine a little and started wearing sunscreen but every time I put the sunscreen over my moisturizer it would burn and again cause my skin to get dry to the point I couldn’t put anything on my face for a couple days because literally everything (even the hydrating cleanser) would cause a lot of burning.,Skincare_Addiction

1684680735.0,What's the skincare sin that you just can't stop doing?,"I've seen like three different posts talking about sun, sun damage, SPF… and I've realized how much I love being under the sun.

I'm from the south of Spain. My family is a family of fishermen. Basically I was raised on the beach and on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, so giving up sunbathing sounds impossible to me.

I'm fully aware of how damaging it is, so I try to do all the possible things to avoid that damage. I wear my SPF religiously, I know what time of the day is the worst/best to lay under the sun, I know tips and tricks to treat the skin after a day on the beach, etc. But if you took away sunbathing from me, if you took away just sitting at a bar table under the sun and drinking something with my friends, if you took sun out of my life, I would literally feel so miserable.

1704305875.0,I'm in shock... go read Skintelligent.,"So I just finished reading Skintelligent by Dr. Natalia Spierings and I think it might have just changed my life. This is going to be a long post. Cross-posted.

Tl;Dr: The book, Skintelligent, radically changed the way I see skincare. Most ""active"" ingredients are marketing scams, and you only need to cleanse once a day with a very gentle, oil-based cleanser no matter your skin type, use targeted, mostly prescription treatments for skin concerns, and use Vaseline at night, and only if you feel dry. Fancy stuff is fine and won't hurt you, but is a waste of money. However, I acknowledge that product preference is a very personal experience and that oil-based products are not for everyone.

I've read two other books on skincare in the past several months as well as done a lot of research on the Internet as I have recently become concerned with some minor signs of aging in my skin. 

The only issue I've had with acne since my early twenties was about 5 years ago when I got an IUD and developed severe cystic hormonal acne. I started spironolactone and have barely seen a few spots since then. I went through a period of depression after that and stopped doing anything to my skin, not even washing it unless I took a shower and that definitely didn't happen every day. Curiously, I still didn't have breakouts. I think I've been pretty lucky in the genetic lottery (only in the realm of skin, my overall health is not great).

But in the last few months, I've been doing better with my mood and wanted to get serious about skincare again. I'm 37 and started noticing fine lines (my mom thinks I'm crazy lol). So I found a moisturizer that was from a reputable company that was ""better"" than the drugstore brands but wouldn't break my bank and bought that, a cleanser, a retinol serum, and sunscreen. I am pretty happy with them but haven't noticed any differences, so I started following this sub and skincare addicts and doing more research and decided that maybe I would ""upgrade"" when I was done with my current products and add a few more actives for anti-aging.

Then someone recommended Skintelligent. The first book I read was written by a skincare journalist, so I wasn't totally sold on it, but I got it with my Kindle Unlimited subscription and figured it couldn't hurt. I was pretty impressed. The author had interviewed dermatologists and seemed to have read the scientific research. I was not surprised by any of her claims and it all made sense from what I remembered from my teen years, but with updated guidance. She described the parts of skin and how they work; skin typing; common issues, what cause them, and treatments and preventative measures; what ingredients to avoid; which actives actually work and how to tell effective products from those with problematic formulations; and what order in which to use the various types of products. I felt better informed, but mostly validated in what I already knew. The second book was more of the same, but perhaps a little less specific. Also, it was written by a dermatologist and she added some information on in-office procedures and more invasive treatments. Again, more validation. Skintelligent, however, was very different.

Dr. Spierings is a consultant dermatologist in the UK and the book was published in 2022. She went much more in depth with her description of skin and with pretty much everything else she explained with actual scientific research backing it up. She explained the issues with most ""scientific"" studies and the ramifications those issues have on their claims. She provided information that indicates the marketing claims of every - and I mean every - active ingredient that hasn't been approved by the FDA (in the US), the MHRA (the UK), and the EMA (the EU) are over-inflated and under-fulfilled. 

Over the counter retinoids? She ""critically appraised the randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled (meaning the effects of the 'vehicle' or cream that included the topical retinoid was compared to the effects of the cream without the retinoid) trials of the use of over the counter vitamin A products in the treatment of facial skin aging. Four of the trials showed no statistically significant differences between the vitamin A derivative product and vehicle. The remaining five trials provided weak evidence... of a mild positive effect on fine facial skin wrinkles only. However, these trials all had major issues with how they were performed which calls into question the validity of any positive results."" 

Vitamin C? ""The negative effects of UV light on skin happen in real time so the antioxidant must be present continuously in or on the skin at the correct concentration without being inactivated. So, if topical vitamins are meant to work as photo-protectants, they need to undergo the same type of vigorous real-life testing as sunscreens. More research is needed."" Also, ""vitamin C is a water-soluble and charged molecule and is repelled by the physical barrier of the cells of the epidermis... Topically applied vitamin C probably does not reach the dermis (the location of the collagen and elastin it supposedly works on) in any significant concentration."" And finally, ""if you have plenty of vitamin C in your blood, topical application does not increase skin vitamin C content.""

Hyaluronic acid? ""There is only one clinical study examining the penetration of HA creams in the epidermis. Though... unblinded and uncontrolled with a very small sample size, it showed both high and low molecular weight HA in a cream base did not penetrate the stratum corneum (the outer layer of skin). 

Niacinamide? ""Any study not sponsored by industry shows equivocal or negative findings.""

On the other hand, topical treatments that are prescribed by a doctor are safe and effective. This includes tretinoin, adapalene, and tazarotene (all versions of retinoic acid or vitamin A derivatives prescribed for acne, psoriasis, and anti-aging),  hydroquinone (the ""gold-standard"" treatment for hyperpigmentation), and azelaic acid (best used for treating skin conditions in pregnancy, there are better, more effective treatments for acne, rosacea, and hyperpigmentation). Glycolic acid was noted to possibly enhance the appearance of skin without compromising its function when used regularly at low concentrations. The author mentioned that it ""probably enhanced the effectiveness"" of hydroquinone in the treatment of solar-induced pigmentation and melasma. Salicylic acid has comedone- (a type of acne) clearing as well as antibacterial properties. While tretinoin is more effective, salicylic acid can be used for mild acne. It is also useful to reduce scale in the treatment of dandruff. Benzoyl peroxide is ""the most powerful topical treatment for acne"" and can safely be used in combination with adapalene, salicylic acid, and antibiotics. Use of BP with tretinoin should be separated with the tretinoin at night and the BP in the morning, if it's necessary. Topical treatments for acne should be used on the entire face and not as a spot treatment, ""in fact, using topical acne medications on fully inflamed lesions potentially further irritates already irritated skin... and might be the reason why acne appears to 'get worse' at the beginning of treatment with a topical retinoid."" However, light therapy for acne or anti-aging is a ""marketing gimmick and won't help.""

For a skincare, she said simple is best. ""Focus on targeted prescription products for your skincare complaint. Everything else is unnecessary."" Her tips for a good routine: ""Use a cleanser you like that doesn't leave your skin feeling super tight or dry afterwards (she recommends oil cleansers for everyone as they are gentle, once a day), use an SPF in a vehicle you like during the day, and use a moisturizer that is as greasy-feeling as you can stand at night (she recommends Vaseline)."" She also recommends ditching eye creams (uses the same active ingredients as products for the whole face at the same concentrations) and the grainy exfoliator (Or anything other than glycolic or salicylic acid in general. Unless you have acne concerns, the skin exfoliates efficiently on its own and doesn't need help. These products have only a temporary effect at best and, at worst, can damage your skin's natural barrier.).

Her product recommendations may not work for you, but I think the principle of simple skincare using only a few effective ingredients is generally a sound one. As I have no concerning symptoms with my skin, I like the adage, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Since I had no issues with less frequent washing and not using actives before, I'll probably be fine if I go back to that and I'll know it's a valid and science-based choice this time. The bottom line: you don't need to spend extra cash on fancy moisturizers, serums, toners, masks or anything else. If you like the products, they are totally fine to use and not harmful. Just don't expect them to do magic.

So I'm going to try it! I'll pare down my routine and see about getting a prescription for tretinoin. And that will be all I'll use. I'll let you know how it goes in a few months!
