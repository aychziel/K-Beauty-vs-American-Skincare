Old routine that I was doing for a few months (bc I was broke and couldn‚Äôt afford my old products)/

I‚Äôve always used CeraVe foaming facial cleanser to wash off makeup or just wash my face in the morning and night. Never given me an issue. 

I‚Äôve been using Peach Slices Snail Rescue Blemish busting toner for awhile too and haven‚Äôt had an issue with it. 

And lastly I‚Äôd just put CeraVe moisturizing cream.

Recently I started using soonjung 2x barrier cream again, and started using (for the first time) beauty of Josean revive eye serum, and I‚Äôm from rice toner. 

So my routine right now is:

1. Wash my face in the am with cerave cleanser, rice toner, wait for it to dry.

2. beauty of josean eye cream, wait for it to dry, 

3. then the peach slices snail rescue, wait for it to dry, 

4. and end with the soonjung 2x cream.

 Sometimes I also add a layer of cerave cream on top after the 2x barrier cream but I haven‚Äôt done that in a bit

I wash my face and do the routine in the am, and before bed as well. So I do this 2x a day, and at night I put frownies on after too. 

Am I doing something wrong? 

I‚Äôve used the 2x barrier cream before and it never gave me issues. I used the peach slices snail rescue before without any issue. The only two really new products I‚Äôve incorporated is the eye serum and rice toner but I‚Äôm only flaky around my mouth. Could it be the toner? Or the snail rescue? Is 2x a day too much? Help!! I was really excited for this routine but it‚Äôs flaking my skin and is also kind of irritated. Again, it‚Äôs only around my mouth!",koreanskincare

Hi everyone, I‚Äôm kinda big noob in the skincare game and I‚Äôll explain my strange post title. 

I‚Äôm f21 and as of now, I don‚Äôt had many skin problems, appart a bit acne on teenage years, far from being annoyed by. And since I‚Äôm 18-19, I‚Äôm pretty much done with that without any treatment or specious skin care routine. 
Theses last weeks, I would like to have a better skin routine and I‚Äôve passed some hours to get know more about it. I‚Äôve bought 2 serums for ¬´¬†normal skin¬†¬ª, with good appreciations, good ingredients for doing the best and have a great glass skin like I see on social media (in a big part on TikTok or Pinterest if I‚Äôm totally honest, but with some cheaper products possibly üòÄ).

Or if serums are juste bad for me and my skin.?. :/ 

I should say, I‚Äôm not really patient and If it would have noticeable good difference, when it comes, after how long does it have an effect?

1712530176.0,Thoughts on the COSRX Peptide Booster serum ?,"Hi I was curious if other people tried the COSRX peptide booster serum ?

So far I am using it as a ""pre toner"" product, as I often wash my face and don't put my skin care products immediatly after, especially in the morning, I would rinse my face, prepare my coffee and once it gets ready I would do my skincare routine. So I would use that peptide booster right after rinsing my face so it doesn't get too dry and so far my skin seem to love it. Most of the products I use are oriented towards hydratation and glow finish so I can't say if it did a difference but my skin seem to like this product well.

My skin type is combo, in summer it's more oily, in winter it tends to be more dry/dehydrated. I have been getting a lot of compliments on my skin recently, I don't think it is only due to it but I do think it helped to the overall look of my skin.

My routine is currently:

AM:

* rinse my face with water
* COSRX Peptide booster serum (then I usually do something else as my skin hates when I apply my products too quickly)
* Laneige Cerapeptide Toner or  Glow Recipe Cloud Berry Essence (depends on my mood)
* Serum Goodal Vita C
* Face cream Mary & May (if my skin is dryer I would use the black tube with Idebanone, if I feel my skin is plump enough with hydration I would use the green tube that is more of a gel (followed by spf if I go out)

PM:

* Belif face wash ( or I would double wash if I have lots of makeup/spf on)
* COSRX Peptide booster Serum
* Laneige Cerapeptide Toner or I'm From Fig Essence or Mary & May Black Berry Essence
* Serum Erborian Ginseng
* Face Cream Mary & May Idebanone ( sometimes I switch to one of the moisturizer from Belif)
* if needed I would add a night oil from Erborian, their ""Skin Therapy"" oil, but I rarely need it.

1712193662.0,"Dear, Klairs Fundamental water gel cream vs Peach & Lily","Hello, I am in my late 30s and have sensitive /combination skin. I have been loving my Peach & Lily Matcha pudding moisturizer, however I am almost out of product . I saw on iHerb they are having a 20% off site wide today and was interested in the Klair‚Äôs water gel cream as a substitute. It is less expensive and you receive  more product compared to the Peach & Lily. I am also enticed due to the fact that I have been loving Klairs unscented supple preparation toner and their vitamin E mask that I use at night. 
Has anyone here with my similar skin type tried the gel water cream and the matcha pudding and have a preference? I use the matcha pudding moisturizer in the AM after my Mad Hippie vitamin C serum. Any information or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

1712073640.0,2 things to consider when choosing a dermatology in Korea,"I‚Äôm a local Korean 
Went to over 20 different clinics probably closer to 40 (consultations and medications included) to treat acne, acne scars, pigments, enlarged pores. I probably had procedures done at about 10 different clinics. 

I would like to share a bit of my personal experience after spending thousands of dollars  on so many different clinics to treat my acne prone skin and pigments. But keep in mind that this is just from my personal experience, but also‚Ä¶ these are just really basic things all Korean locals would consider before choosing a dermatology but I noticed that most foreigners don‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ 

1. Make sure the dermatology has board certified dermatologists
 - This is probably the most basic & important thing to consider because getting your skin treated at a ‚Äúdermatology‚Äù without board certified dermatologists is just like getting plastic surgery from a family physician or a doctor who isn‚Äôt a specialist in plastic surgery or going to a gynecology run by a non board certified dermatologist.
- I realized this after seeing less improvements, getting deeper scarring and receiving risky acne prescriptions from NON board certified dermatologies

2. Check the kind of laser machine they have (this is the SECOND most important thing not the first)
You need to make sure that the dermatology machines are being used by someone who specializes in dermatology!!!

1711800280.0,I don't understand my skin anymore,"Hi, 22(f) here. I've used some skincare off and on before, but this time I really wanted to commit to it and take care of my skin a little better.

Without skincare I'd say I have combination skin, where my T-zone can be really dehydrated and flaky, but also greasy at the same time. My chin and jawline gets greasy easily as well and my cheeks can be just dry.

Well, I started a new skincare routine and at first my skin seemed so clear an moisturised. Before I started using some Korean skincare products I used two cleansers from cerave (the foaming cleanser and the oil water based cleanser) and my skinbarrier became really sensitive and irritated. Now I was already aware of my sensitive skin since some skincare I used before this could burn my skin as well. 

After this I thought my skin barrier was probably damaged and ordered some Korean skincare to hopefully fix it. Like I said, at first my skin became very clear and hydrated but after a while I started breaking out and noticing my T-zone getting VERY oily during the day. Unfortunately I haven't really been able to rule out what caused this; whether it was a certain product or just hormones or something. I stopped using my sunscreen a while (the boj one) but that didn't help. Then I stopped using my cerave foaming cleanser all at once and I thought it helped at first but it didn't.  

The skincare I use right now is:

AM
-roundlap moisturising cleanser (just bought that yesterday tho)
-purito panthenol rebarrier cream with low ph
-Beauty of Joseon sunscreen with rice prebiotics

PM
-Haruharu wonder oil cleanser
-Roundlap moisturising cleanser (just bought that yesterday tho)
-purito panthenol rebarrier cream with low ph

I'm a little afraid of using acids yet since I feel like I still have to restore my barrier.

My question is: any idea how I can solve my oily (mostly) nose and breakouts? Any idea which product it could be? 

(I thought it could be a sensitivity for niancenamide as well since it is in the moisturiser and the cerave cleanser I don't use anymore, since I've reacted to it before when I used the the ordinary niancenamide serum)

1711709596.0,[Review] Mania Holic Sunscreen Pack 50+ PA+++,"I bought this Korean sunscreen (made in Seoul) at Bologna Cosmoprof. I think this is my holy grail: it feels like I applied nothing on skin (and I have a very oily skin), plus it helps keeping sebum production under control: even after hours my face is not shiny or greasy at all.

Even reapplication is super simple, since the sunscreen does not pill and does not get sticky.

The producer claims something about hydrocolloidal films and some (bullshit?) like that. I don't know how much this is true, but the feeling is amazing, my skin is super smooth.

My concern is on its efficacy and safety: it'a new product, with no review at all, so I wonder if UVA/UVB protection is actually that good or not (remember Purito?).

Anyway, here's the link to producer website: [https://firstmarket2.cafe24.com/shop3/m/product/sunscrren-pack/141/category/116/display/1/](https://firstmarket2.cafe24.com/shop3/m/product/sunscrren-pack/141/category/116/display/1/)

I struggle a lot with my skin flushing a lot, it can look very similar to rosacea, so any advice on what I can get for that would be amazing. 

My skin is quite sensitive so if there's any good moisturizer with little to no perfume that someone could recommend to me I would love that.

I am also deeply in need of a good eye cream as I'm definitely seeing aging signs and I have quite thin skin there.

For a few months now maybe a year, I have developed these dry patches on my cheeks and I don‚Äôt know how to make them go away.

I was able to lighten my years-old acne scars but I‚Äôm not even trying to focus on my acne anymore. I just want to hydrate my skin and get it back to normal. 

Right now after washing my face, I use either the Naturie hatamugi (coix seed) skin conditioner or the HaruHaru wonder black rice toner. Then I go in with either the serum from the cosrx propolis line or just a hyaluronic acid serum.

1710788975.0,Damaged skin barrier? Recommendations,"For the past couple of months I have noticed a quite drastic difference in my skin. I have had peeling, especially on my cheekbones. However, the biggest problem is the breakouts of blackheads and closed comedones all over my forehead. Also, all of my skincare has started to burn. The only way I can tolerate putting anything on my face without burning is by first applying organic aloe vera gel. 

As far as my current routine, I tend to rotate products based on what I think I need. For cleanser I have been using the la roche posay purifying foaming cleanser or the cosrx snail mucin one. For moisturizer I also use the cosrx snail mucin one or one of the la roche posay ones. However I noticed the most burning with those so I went back to the cerave moisturizing cream which seems to work a bit better. I sometimes use salycilic acid on my forehead because I thought it might help with the breakouts but I don‚Äôt necessarily see that it is making a difference and I fear it might be too drying? I‚Äôm also a big fan of pimple patches since I tend to be a picker as well (bad, I know). 

I saw a video on tiktok that made me think that the cause of these issues may be a damaged skin barrier? Maybe the winter weather dried my face out too badly and I didn‚Äôt realize it?

1710439507.0,How often do you switch your skincare products ?,"**For people who have more than the minimum of products, how often do you rotate/ switch between two products ? (skin type: combination, not sensitive)**

I love getting new products but I obviously can't use them all at the same time, I try to keep my routine with toner/essence + serum + moisturizer (aside from face wash and spf if i go out).

I have mostly a lot of choices in my toners/essences, but I often find myself unsure how to rotate them, so far I tried to use the same ones and whenever I feel like it I would switch to another one, while keeping the ones for day and night.

**Those are the 7 toners/essences I have for example:**

\- I'm From Fig Boosting Essence ( I use it at night especially in winter)

\- Laneige Cerapeptide Mist ( I use it in the morning or through the day if my skin need a boost)

\-  Sollala Multi Vitamin Refresh Toner ( it's a brightening product so I think to keep it for the morning)

1710382101.0,first time trying kskincare with combo/oily skin!,"hi! i‚Äôm a 21yr old just switching from regular skincare like la roche posay to korean skincare! i just tried french skincare, from typology, but it wasn‚Äôt doing much for my skin. i don‚Äôt have any significant skin problems, i believe my face is not sensitive at all, but i seem to consistently have skin barrier issues. i usually get two pimple in the same area (cheek near nose), have deep blackheads and just overall textured looking skin (i assume because of the horrendously extreme products i‚Äôve used in middle school like panoxyl and bio-oilüò≠)! i‚Äôve just been using ROUND LAB mugwort cream because i ran out of moisturizer and PURITO daily soft touch spf for the past week, but i want to get a full korean skincare routine. if anyone can help please let me know if these items i‚Äôm planning to purchase seem okay! i also wear makeup pretty often which probably clogs my pores, so if there are any non comedogenic likes you‚Äôd like to put me on to, feel free!! :))",koreanskincare
1710362912.0,Is it normal for the Roundlab Dokdo Toner to tingle? ,"Hello! My HG Acwell Licorice Toner has mysteriously disappeared from Stylevana‚Äôs site. On my hunt for a new toner, I came across Roundlab‚Äôs.

Heard raving reviews, stylevana had a buy 2 get 1 free promotion event. It was too good to not buy!

I had known it had protease and sugarcane but everyone kept saying the exfoliation was super gentle and okay for daily use. I thought my sensitive skin (who HATES Salicylic acid) would be able to handle it (it can handle retinoid and Vit C just fine)

But now I‚Äôve tried it on for the first time and my face tingled as if I added retinoids on. 
To be safe, I left out any other actives usually in my routine. My face still feels tingly, is this normal or is my skin just having a bad day? (Sometimes my face tingles and is more sensitive for no reason, even when I‚Äôve used no active at all)

Also, would it be safe to use this toner with Beauty of Joseon‚Äôs 20% Vit C (alternative)?

New to the world of Korean skincare.
I'm a 31 woman looking to take care of my skin properly (haven't done so much in the past few years due to depression etc.)
So I'm ready for the next step! I've been looking at some videos and articles about the 10 steps routine etc. As someone who doesn't use make-up on a daily basis and who doesn't spend large amounts of time out in the sun, what are the best products for someone like me? I have a fair skin with visible pores and some texture, sometimes dry on some area, not much acne (aside from a pimple or two every now and then), I do have dark circles and eye/smile wrinkles around the corner.
I picked up a few products from the list shown but I'm not sure if I picked twice the same products from different brands or if I picked up what was necessary for the 10 steps. I'm looking for something that will remove the ""dull"" from my skin, fix my pores and ease the coming wrinkles! Any advice or tips are appreciated:)",koreanskincare

I have dry skin with just the occasional pimple so my focus is always hydration! I would love to hear anyones dry skin recommendations! Or any for deep underground pimples because the few that I get are always those in the same spots (ugh). But here are some of my mini reviews from my most recent haul!!


Round Lab Birch Juice Moisturizing Pads - So far these have been amazing!! I have been using them as mini sheet masks and the hydration is unreal, I highly recommend.

Round Lab Birch Juice Sunscreen - (repurchase) I love this sunscreen, its like a second moisturizer. My dry skin loves it. My favorite sunscreen so far and I have tried quite a few.

Amplen Ceramide Shot Ampoule - Haven't tried this yet, testing it out on my hand it is a bit sticky but definitely very hydrating 

Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum - Been using this for a few days now, its great! But I think the round lab is still my favorite.

ILLIYOON Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream- (repurchase) This is very heavy and great to seal everything in, but I actually don't consider it to be very hydrating, just good at sealing in moisture from other products

MEDI-PEEL Extra Super 9+ 2.0 - Haven't tried this yet, but i cannot wait to!

Olive Young Care Plus Spot Cover Spot Patch-- 102 patches!! Cant pass that up, plus I have heard great things

BIODANCE Hydro Cera-Nol Real Deep Mask Sheet-- My influenced purchase, I love anything with extreme hydration!

acropass Trouble Cure - Haven't tried these yet but I love microdart patches for deep pimples and wanted to try a new brand, these come with a cleansing step!",koreanskincare

Right now I'm using the GOODAL Green Tangerine Vitamin C Serum and  SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Asiatica Ampoule, but I'm just not seeing the results I'd like. I thought maybe I should try a tranxemic acid treatment. I've heard good things about both the Haruharu Wonder Dark Spot and the Anua Dark Spot, but not sure which one to try...any suggestions?

I currently use a local salicylic acid facewash, nuetrogena hydro boost water gel, skinaqua sunscreen and a 0.5% adaplene gel given by a derm at night. Sometimes I use the pixi vitamin c toner.

I have comedonal acne, oily, textured skin but it dries out a bit where I use the gel. I am south asian and have some pigmentation as well as spots from acne. Currently I get acne very less as compared to before a derm gave me the above routine but I randomly get white pimples and I've never had completely clear skin.

I am currently thinking:
-Add oil cleanse step with the Klairs Gentle Black Fresh cleansing oil
-Same local facewash of salicylic acid (please lmk if there's a suggestion)
-Add a toner (I am confused with which one and should I focus on hydration or exfoliation, I am currently leaning towards a hydrating one but I have no idea which.)
-Use the mixsoon bean essence
-Use Axis Y Dark Spot Correcting Glow Serum
-Same moisturiser (or if i should use smth else)

I've also heard great things about the Cocokind chlorophyll discoloration serum. I've also seen people use Anua heartleat toner pads with the jelly and exfoliation side for hyperpigmentation.

I would really appreciate any suggestions for an AM/PM routine. I've gotten bits and pieces from South Asian skincare creators online but ofc not one thing fits all. But I'd appreciate any guidance either way. 

Thankyou so much. I really want to clear up my skin in my 20s, it's been years of struggles.

1709744784.0,best products on accutane,"Hi!! I just started accutane a couple weeks ago and am so excited for my journey. Naturally, I need to use very gentle, sensitive skin oriented skincare. Most derms recommend  brands like CeraVe / La Roche Posay etc but in the past my skin didn't like those much. 

Obviously I will need something very moisturizing with no actives (since my skin will be peeling anyway) so I decided start looking into kbeauty products - also something to fade my hyper-pigmentation - Currently I use DHC moisturizer and Bio-oil for the scarring. 

i just purchased COSRX Daily SPF 50 Vitamin E Sunscreen and Illiyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream. Hoping to cycle in the cream at night time while using the DHC in the morning. 

Are these products good?? has anyone used kbeauty on accutane?  I am excited to get started, Let me know if you have any other recommendations!! Thanks!",koreanskincare

In the photos, you‚Äôll see that my face has a lot of bumps and some mild redness. Maybe it‚Äôs rosacea? I‚Äôm not sure. I also have some patches of darker skin on the side of my cheeks. Maybe it‚Äôs melasma? 

My skin is combo. Oily t zone and dry cheeks. I have my moisturizer on which is why the photo has some shine.

1709686527.0,Review of Illyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream,"I never ever write reviews but I feel like this product deserves a huge shoutout.

I‚Äôve always had combination oily skin.  But now that I‚Äôm in my mid 40s my skin has just become all over dry.  However, I have never ever had any sensitivity to any products regardless of ingredients or scents. But I must have finally come in contact with the one product that my skin does not love, although I have still not figured out what exactly it is. My under eyes and eyelids all of a sudden became extremely red, dry, inflamed and burned with every product I applied.  Since I don‚Äôt know what caused it I decided to cut out all actives and just go back to the basics.  I did a ton of research and decided to try the Avene eye contour cream to help and hopefully heal my irritation.  While I did notice VERY minimal improvement each day that passed while using the Avene eye cream, the improvement was extremely slow and not doing what I had hoped it would do.  

So I went back to doing more research and decided to purchase the Illyoon Ceramide Ato Concentrate Cream, and all I have to say is HOLY COW.  I used it the very first night I received it on my face,including my under eyes and eyelids, and when I woke up the very next morning, ALL irritation was 100% gone.  No redness, no burning, no inflammation, no itching!  It had all disappeared overnight like magic. Plus the moisture this provided was just incredible. Like I said, my skin became dry as I got older and I finally found my cure.  This product will forever be in my skincare line up.  I cannot recommend this product enough.  

I know everyone‚Äôs skin is different and may not react the same way as someone else‚Äôs but I write this in hopes of helping someone who may be going through the struggles I did, this product is worth a shot.  For me it was a miracle in a bottle.  ",koreanskincare

1709585299.0,skincare review :D,"hii

after almost one month of using most of the items i'm doing a review cause why not (there will be lots of beauty of joseon productscause the first time i got into korean skincare it was the first brand that popped up on my feed. I am now aware of all the other brands lol)
 
I have normal to dry skin with a slightly oiler t-zone. Unfortunately despite all the skincare i have lots of tiny bumps and red spots on my face. i recently ordered the isntree BHA 2% essence to try some exfoliation, i'll let you know how it is when the package arrives. 

CLEANSERS 
Boj ginseng cleaning oil: i like the fact that it doesn't have a smell and doesn't leave a film. It leaves my skin quite clean, but it cannot get rid of my sebaceous filaments, so i'll try another oil cleanser next time. Takes a whooooole lot to use the whole bottle, like 3 months. Overall it's pretty meh.

Boj green plum cleanser: this one is nice, really gentle, makes my skin clean and doesn't strip. But i think next time i'll buy the round lab dokdo cleanser cause i heard so many good reviews about it and i love that brand. 


TONER 
i'm from rice toner: it does everything a toner should do: hyrdates your skin, and gives a nice glow. A bit pricey tho :/ but that's fine. 

SERUM 
Boj glow serum: it makes my skin glowing (ig it really lives up to his name lol) and that's it. After 3 weeks use along with the toner i definitely noticed a glowier skin tho. 

MOISTURISER
Boj dynasty cream: mmmh i'm not sure about this one. Sometimes it leaves my skin a bit tight, and i'm afraid this product might be the cause of the many bumps and smalll pimples i have on my skin, they appeared a few days ago and i've used the cream for more than one month. I recently ordered the round lab birch juice moisturiser, i'll update you about it 

SUNSCREEN 
Roundlab birch juice moisturising sunscreen: if perfection would be embodied in a sunscreen, it would be the birch juice moisturising sunscreen. Literally perfect, flawless. Hydrates my skin, doesn't leave a white cast, and makes my skin so smooth. Some people even complimented my skin because of this sunscreen's effect, it felt awesome. 

MASK
Boj red bean pore mask: it feels like it doesn't do anything to my skin. really. i think my skin prefers clay masks. 

I hope this helps! Let me know your opinions and concerns! I'd love to hear some recommendations from you guys! have a great day and clear skin <3",koreanskincare

1709548110.0,How to rotate Toner/Essences when they have similar actions ?,"&#x200B;

I really love toners and essences, I think they are my favorite step of my skincare. I recently ordered a skincare box and ended up with a couple more essences. So now I am a bit unsure how to maybe rotate them, so far I just used whatever I felt like using that day as they have similar actions. It's not in the picture but I also have the Belif toner, Laneige Cerapeptide (my favorite with the Fig Essence of I'm From) and the Multi Vitamin Toner from Sollalla.

**I have combination skin, not sensitive but reactive sometimes if I am very stressed/apply my products without letting them fully sink in or if the tab water is too hard**.

So far my routine used to be, regarding the toner/Essences step, to use in the morning Laneige Cerapeptide and in the evening the Fig Essence.

I finished my Laneige toner so in the morning I kind of switched every day what I used. But I am trying to use this week for example in the morning the Mugwort Essence (and still the Fig Essence at night).

They all have anti aging/hydrating/pore care/ brightening... properties.

How do you suggest I could rotate my products ?

I was thinking maybe to have period when I could use **I'm From Fig Essence+ Mugwort Essence**, and another time to use instead the **Epona Premium Birch Juice + COSRX 6 Peptide Booster**",koreanskincare

My current routine has been: 

Cerave acne cleanser in the morning 

Cerave Hydrating Toner in the Morning. 

Cerave Vitamin E serum 

Followed by Cerave moisturizer with SPF....I was going through a kick idk. 

In the evening I use 

Cerave hydrating foaming cleanser which I would say does a decent job of cleaning makeup off my face but I feel like it could do better. 

Same toner from the morning. 

Cerave Retinol 

Cerave nightcream with peptides.   
In addition to those microcomedones being a concern I do have pretty large pores, I'm trying to be mindful of fine lines as I get older (I'm only 31 but ya know) and I do work outside since I am a Park Ranger, so a good moisturizer with SPF is a must, I am pretty fair skinned so I do burn easily.

For example I love using the I'm From Fig Essence at my night routine (I have combination skin) but whenever I go to that place my skin hate it and I would get red itchy areas on my face). I then have to wash my face, use a micellar water to rinse the tab water and then sprit some of my favorite mist from Caudalie.

I noticed however that my skin react less in products in a mist (as I don't have to rub them in my skin).

So I know I will 100% bring my Laneige Cerapeptide toner in a mist HOWEVER I wanted to try if my skin could agree with I'm From Mugwort Essence, but I don't know if it is because it is thicker than the Laneige one, but in the same type of mist bottle, the product just come so aggressively ,I feel the bottle just spit on my face instead of having a nice fine mist.

I have sensitive oily/combination, acne prone skin with large pores, and have those stubborn blackheads on my nose and chin area. I also get dark under eye circles and some redness at times.

I'm currently using the Cosrx Snail Mucin Essence which is ok, but i don't think it's having it's fair shot alongside the other products i'm already using.

I use the himalaya neem cleanser atm which is a bit too stripping and I use a lot of the ordinary, so salicylic acid, niacinamide and retinol, i switch it up on different nights. I also use the hyaluronic acid in the mornings.

I'm thinking the Anua cleansing oil, cream cleanser and the toner? Any advice, recommendations would be amazing! A moisturiser recommendation would be amazing too! As i'm always petrified of them because most times an extra moisturiser breaks me out.

P.S over all my skin is ok, i just want it to be optimal and more consistent, rather than every other day theres an issue!

Thanks :)",koreanskincare

I bought a new hair oil from Mediall on Amazon, the reviews are good, but I was worried about the brand because it's new to me, I bought it anyway because it's the same manufacturer as the Korean cosmetics I usually use. The price was reasonable, and the scent lasted longer on my hair than I thought it would.

Because of this sub I came across Stylevana which allowed me to do a full Korean skincare haul that delivered to Canada - yay! I ordered my products based off of product recommendations in other posts. For context, I am 27F with normal-to-combination skin who lives in Canada (4-season climate). My T-zone tends to get oily. I mostly struggle with texture, redness and unevenness. 

I am hoping to get some advice on what products I can use on a daily basis together as well as morning vs. evening. I am also open to any/all suggestions to add, remove or adjust within my routine. 

I have the basics outlined: 

1. **Oil cleanser** (Evening) - I got 2 different types to try them both out
2. **Water-based cleanser** (Morning/Evening) - Isntree Green Tea Fresh Cleanser
3. ***Exfoliate/Toner/Essence/Ampoule*** *- This is where I need advice*
4. **Moisturizer -** Gel cream in morning and intensive barrier cream in evening
5. **SPF (**Morning) - Trying out 2 different recommendations 

*Jumiso All Day Vitamin Brightening & Balancing Facial Serum*  
*Pyunkang Yul Essence Toner*  
*COSRX Full Fit Propolis Synergy Toner*  
*COSRX Snail Mucin Essence*

I have a combination skin, not sensitive but sometimes reactive, I live most of the year in a cold climate and other in a hot humide one. I won't review the european products aside if someone ask for it in the comment as it may be out of this sub:

\- Belif Face wash: One of my favorite face wash, it smell so fresh and leaves my skin really good.

\- Isntree Mugwort calming mask: It's okay. I think I need a stronger products as it didn't do much for my black heads.

\- Belif Toner: It is my 3rd bottle, I often go back to a lot of Belif products as I love the brand on my skin, but it's quite pricy in my country so I always wait the sales. It is quite moisturizing especially in the summer and again I love the smell.

\- I'm From Rice Toner: I haven't tried it for super long but it's not my favorite from the brand, it is very moisturizing though. I probably won't buy it again.

\- I'm From Fig Essence: My favorite product from the brand !! I know it didn't got as much love as the Mugwort or the rice toner but I absolutely love it. I like my products to have a nice smell and sadly for me it doesn't smell of anything. The packaging is lovely too and since the products is not cheap I appreciate to have a pretty product at least, it makes me enjoy the experience even more. It is VERY moisturizing but I haven't got more pimples surprisingly as I have an acne prone skin. And it gives me an amazing glow. So far I only use it an night.

\- Klairs Midnight calming blue cream: I haven't tried it for very long and my skin didn't reacted to anything so far so I didn't used it to notice calming effects so I may update the post later.

\- Abib Heartleaf calming pads : Love the packaging, but I didn't noticed a huge calming effect on my skin. It is a nice toner pads to use in lazy mornings though.

\- Belif moisturizer : I have the vitamin C and the original cream I love them both very much, they smell amazing and don't irritate my skin, they are the face creams I often go back to.

\- Some By Me Retinol Intense serum: I haven't noticed any change in my fine lines so far but the retinol in it didn't irritated me at all. The bottle is beautiful too BUT I find it very hard to get the product, I don't know if it's because it is thick or the pipette thing that doesn't get enough products.

\- Kahi Multi Balm and Aqua Balm : I love them ! They are expensive for the quantity and there is probably cheaper option out there but I don't use mine every day and I have them for quite a long time. As you noticed the packaging and smell of a product is important to me, a bland bottle with 0 smell makes me give up skincare very quickly. And they look really pretty and smell great, also it is really good to moisturize some parts of the face that turns dry. I don't use them all over my face (except the Aqua balm which is a SPF 50 I love to use it especially around my eyes) but the multi balm except some colder days in winter I would use it on some small parts of my face. I think I would buy them again !

\- Round Lab sunscreen: I love it, it is very light and doesn't sting my face like a lot of SPF creams

\- Laneige Mist bottle: Loved it too, it is empty now but I plan to buy more. When I bought it I didn't had high expectations as while reading the main ingredients it wasn't anything clear to me like the I'm From products which have rice, figs, mugwort, pears... so I was confused what the Laneige really had or if it would really do something. Surprinsingly I worked great for me, I feel I could spray it in the hot summer and be good in the day, no serum, no cream! So far it's winter so I use it as a regular toner and I really liked it. It worked better at calming my skin also than a lot of heartleaf and cica products.

\- Belif Cica cream: I didn't liked it so much, it must be the Belif product I liked the less... The packaging is great but I don't like the smell at all, it doesn't have the same smell as any of the other products. Also it didn't calmed my skin during irritated times. I don't think Cica really do much for me honestly.

\- Soo Good pads: They are very nice as a mask but the jar takes a lot of place and I wish it had a more elegant look as the Abib ones. I don't like the smell of it very much though..

\- Heimish All Clean balm Mandarin: very nice balm, smell like orange tree flower (I prefer the Banila Co Orange cleansing balm though which smelled like a fresh orange juice !)

\- Goodal Vitamin C serum: LOVE IT the smell just put me in such a great mood in the morning and gives a great glow as most vitamin C serums. I do find the pump is a bit hard to push.

\- Erborian Oil: It feels nice ( I am not a fan of oils in general but it is a good one).

\- Erborian Ginseng serum: LOVE IT, I also loved their Yuzu serums but they are so expensive... Bottle is beautiful, products smells great and you can see results so fast !!!",koreanskincare

1706201555.0,What is your favorite I'm From toner/essence and why ?,"Age: 29 years old , Skin type: Combination (reactive sometimes but not sensitive)

So I bought all 3 essences/toner from the brand I'M FROM, and I would like to stick with 2 of them for morning/night skincare or ideally only one. So far I only tested the Rice Toner and Fig essence, I ordered the Mugwort one but I haven't received it yet. Here are my thoughts so far:

\- Fig Essence: I'm on my 2nd bottle, I think it is really my favorite, I have been using it in the evening only as it is a bit think. It doesns't has any smell which is a bit of a downside for me as I love my prodcuts to have a pleasent smell, it really helps me to relax while I do my skincare. The packaging is also beautiful. I got it on sale but the product is not cheap at full price so I really like that the bottle looks pretty. It moisturize really well and gave me beautiful glow

\- Rice Toner: I haven't tried it for as long as the Fig Essence but so far I like it too but not as much, I haven't noticed a huge difference with my skin but at the same time my skin is quite good at the moment so there is not much to ""fix"", the bottle is in plastic (while the Fig and Mugwort essences are in a glass bottle). I know some people were able to smell a slight rice smell from it but personally I can't smell anything on it. It moisturize well too and I liked the feeling of my skin after it. I didn't had the ""wow"" effect I had with the Fig essence but I barely saw people talking about the Fig one while all the rave is about the Rice toner hahaha

I will update about the Mugwort essence once I receive it and try it for a couple of weeks, my skin is sometimes reactive, not to ingredients but to ""situations"" so if I have been stressed out or if I'm in a rush and apply my products too quickly without waiting for each products to sink in fully, then I would get some red itchy areas on my face, that usually go away by themself after 30min or if I rinse off my face. So I was hoping the Mugwort Essence may help during those times (though so far my holy grail to calm my skin then is the Eau de Raisin from Caudalie but during winter it doesn't hydrate enough).

But I was curious, which one of those products are your favorite and why ? ( please if you can refer your skin type as well).",koreanskincare

1705896192.0,How do I remove spf without oil cleansing,"Hello, my skin is combination-oily & acne prone, but currently has seasonal dryness, clogged pores, blackheads and damaged barrier.
I haven't started using Korean products yet but I will soon. As I'm acne prone/combo oily, I was suggested to double cleanse with a gel cleanser instead of oil. For that, I purchased a Cosrx low pH gel cleanser and Etude Soon Jung whip cleanser
I dont know how much of each to use and how to apply it. I do tend to use too much of my current cleanser sometimes because I have a fear that I need a lot to clear out the oily gunk but then I end up drying my skin out too much and I fear that I will do the same with the double cleansing.

 Additionally, I also started to use SPF, as well as slug with Vaseline at night to help my barrier. (I did that a while ago after trying to use a small amount of my current cleanser but I don't know if my SPF is still on my face) I need a technique to remove these products without having to dry out my skin, but without oil cleansing.

Can someone who also has a similar case with not using an oil cleaner give me a guide on how to double cleanse properly? (like how many pumps to use, how to massage, etc) I'd really appreciate it! Thank you!",koreanskincare

I‚Äôm 19F and going to preface this by saying i‚Äôm new to Korean skincare / beauty and don‚Äôt know much, but that being said i just finished a 6 month round of Accutane and am looking for product recommendation/advice! Beforehand I had oily skin and struggled with acne and scarring. Now however I‚Äôm more Normal to Oily and mostly struggle with scarring from acne with occasional small acne but very rarely. The acne I get now is more small bumps under the skin which go away within 2 days. I‚Äôm also concerned about any extra oil that may be on my face as I still produce some oil and want to try and control that as well if possible. 

I‚Äôm looking for products to help with the scarring and fading them. As well as preventing new acne, something that I can use daily for both or most days out of the week. I‚Äôm thinking also an exfoliator or a toner with aha and bha to help open and clear pores as well but I‚Äôm willing to try things that don‚Äôt have that as well! 

Currently I‚Äôm using the Advanced Night Repair from Est√©e Lauder and Moisture surge from Clinique but I love both these products and want to keep them in my routine, however if there is something that is better i‚Äôm completely willing to try those too, these are just some things that have been working for me. I do have the snail mucin from Cosrx which is also nice and i‚Äôve been using that about 2/3 times a week. I‚Äôm mostly looking for just a toner or exfoliator and some serums to help me with any acne and scarring as well as to help control oil. Also I don‚Äôt know if i should be using something for skin barrier? I‚Äôve tried a Dr.Jart moisturizer that I loved while I was on Accutane just not sure if it‚Äôs 100% needed as I‚Äôm no longer on it and I‚Äôm not sure if it would be to heavy?

1705724990.0,I'm confused about my skin barrier and I don't know if I should buy an exfoliant,"Hi! As a complete beginner to korean skincare (and skincare routine in general tbh) I've seen that you should exfoliate chemically (use AHA/BHA) once/twice a week so your skincare absorbs well, but I also heard that it's not good to use actives on damaged skin barriers. After doing a bit of research, I'm very confused about my skin barrier.

I don't have extreme skin conditions, just quite a few acne scars, hyperpigmentation, texture, etc. Usually I have combination to oily acne prone skin but it tends to get dry because of the weather rn. I haven't established any sort of routine yet, I'm still in the process of developing one and buying things so the only things I use rn are a cetaphil cleanser, neutrogena toner & a nivea moisturizer

After cleansing and waiting for around 10 minutes, I feel dryness in my skin and if I smile or stretch my skin a little it feels very crusty and dry and it hurts quite a bit. When I apply my toner after cleansing, it stings quite a bit the first time. I'm not sure if this is because of the seasonal dryness or if its because I have a damaged skin barrier, or even if it's because I use too much product (I always single cleanse and I use around 4-5 pumps and massage for around 1 minute). I don't want to damage my skin further so I'm not sure if I should use exfoliants, but I also want the products I will buy to absorb well.

&#x200B;

To be frank- I know NOTHING about Korean skin care. Nothing. However, I admire how much Korean skin care is amazing. It amazes me that so many people can take care of their skin. My skin has never been that bad when it comes to acne. I'm very fortunate. Buuuuut..... I do have blackhead and pore problems. I used to take the [Jafra Pore cleanser](https://www.jafra.com/skincare/treat/acne-blemish-treatments/JAFRA-ROYAL-Clear-Smart-Clear-Pore-Hydrator). My mom's friend gave it to me. It worked really good on my skin when I tried it out then I ran out. Now I am curious in wanting to try something similar to this product. I hear lots of good things about Korean skin care.

1704917651.0,My Lamiche Experience,"I visited Seoul 2 weeks ago and visited Lamiche clinic while there. I wanted to share my experiences and also open up the chance for yall to ask questions :)

I found Lamiche through social media searching for skincare clinics. They seemed to have a very good reputation and I found many Tiktoks/Insta reels by foreigners. I do speak Korean but my husband does not so I was interested in places that worked with foreigners quite frequently.

**PRE-VISIT!** I initially contacted Lamiche via Kakao Talk. I always do this because I know places often charge foreigners different prices, and I felt the a bit iffy about not finding any prices in English. Once they realized I was not Korean, I was shuttled over to their foreigner account and was provided their package pricing. I didn't think anything of the package model at first, however I realized during the sales consultation at the clinic how ridiculous it is. More on that later. I did like that they were receptive about my concerns regarding laser treatments and my skin color, and they asked for photos of my face before confirming in advance that I could receive laser treatments.

**DOCTOR'S CONSULTATION!** The visit started out well. They did skin imaging after which I met with the sales rep/translator who did a basic intro of skin health and acne. The doctor came in for maybe 5 minutes and just explained areas that we would benefit from treatment.

**SALES CONSULTATION!** We were called into an office with the sales rep/translator and presented charts with what the doctor recommended. I forgot my tax bracket and accepted everything the doctor recommended. In total I spent 5k won. I was offered a discount (sorry I don't remember how much) in exchange for posting on social media which I accepted (this is my post - sorry Lamiche). They also came back a third time and offered me botox and threads for free which I refused and honestly found very weird because I was very clear at the beginning that I did not want those at all.

Back to the  pricing, Lamiche has package options for foreigners (pricing for Koreans is different). One laser was about 300k won, the the price of the individual laser went down the more lasers/treatments you purchased. For example, purchasing 8 lasers led to an individual price of about 100k won. However, charging 300k won for one laser without knowing individual pricing means they can charge you 300k for a laser that is worth less than what you are paying. My husband only wanted one or two laser so I was frantically googling what would be the best bang for his buck. They did not provide a pricing list for individual lasers/injections.

That being said, definitely hem and haw. At the end of the day, it's sales and they are willing to a little give and take. I wish I asked for them to do more neck treatments.

**AFTERCARE INSTRUCTIONS!** Once consultation and payment was done, I was given a verbal list of aftercare instructions. Most of it I don't remember tbh and I had to keep texting them in the following weeks to ask if this or that was ok. I remember they said no actives for 2 months, but when I texted, they said one month. I think it would be really helpful for the clinic to provide written aftercare instructions. But for now, it would be good to go ready to take some notes.

**PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS!** My husband and I were both prescribed medications that would could fill across the street. We were prescribed some antibiotics, melanin inhibitors, etc. The sales consultant/translator asked if we were taking any medications and I mentioned broadly some medications I took (think saying antibiotics instead of saying doxycycline). He said ""oh thats fine"" and I was like ok great. However, after getting home, I realized like wait, he's not a doctor and he didn't even ask about my specific medications. My medication is prone to interactions so I tried to find interactions online but I could not find the medications they prescribed.  So I texted the clinic and asked again. After checking with the doctor, the doctor said ""check with your US doctor to make sure you can take the medications since they prescribed your medication"". SIR??? YOU PRESCRIBED THESE TO ME! The doctor should have absolutely checked what medication I was taking in detail before even writing a prescription. This feels like medical malpractice issue ready to happen. I ended up not taking the medications because it was Christmas holiday and I could not get in touch with my US doctor.

**TREATMENT!** Then I was sent down to the the treatment floor. The treatment process was insane. First off, don't let anyone lie to you, that shit HURTS. My husband heard people screaming (the staff said it was common) and he cancelled some procedures half way through his treatment. The doctor wanted me to take a numbing injection in my butt because I was going to have so many procedures but I really didn't want that so they topically numbed my face with cream twice and injections 2-3 times. In retrospect, I am glad I refused the butt shot because again, they did not check any of my medical history to make sure that would be safe for me. Even with all the numbing it hurt although I found most tolerable. The Ulthera laser was the absolute worst, and I was getting treatments from roughly 5pm to 11pm. They did give me a really nice vibrating spikey ball to help distract me from the pain. They did come to me mid procedure (pre-Ulthera hell) and offered me a discount on something on my neck and I was like fuck it, let's do it. But the staff were great, especially once they found out I could speak Korean. The male doctor doing most of the procedures chatted with me (as much as I could manage) and the nurses were lovely too. There was also a female translator who stuck around until 11pm when my treatment was done and she was lovely! Shout out to her. I hope she got paid overtime.

**POST TREATMENT!** After bandaging up my injection points, I was ready to go home. Personally, I feel like you pay 5k and are at the clinic until 11pm, I think they should at least call you a cab but that just me. We left and grabbed fried chicken nearby in a place that was popping, before heading home after hailing a cab. Under my chin was definitely very sore as they said but otherwise I felt fine. I had some skin tenderness so I couldn't not use pressure when washing my face but that went away after about 3 days.  I'll be honest - with all the crazy stuff they did to my skin, I am still in awe that I did not get/need painkillers to take home. That being said my skin was SO dry and the products they gave were not at all hydrating enough. I ended up doing an Olive Young run to buy products because my skin was so so dry. 2 weeks out, I still have some numbness under my chin but otherwise feel totally fine. My husband came out with some crazy skin bruising under his chin (he said they were making a v-line) but I can't speak much for that since I wasn't there for his treatment.

**RESULTS!** That being said, their lasers/procedures definitely work. My skin is so much clearer and smoother, but I do not see much brightening. That being said, I didn't expected not to get blackheads two weeks after the service but maybe that was  just poor knowledge on my part. In any case, double cleansing cleans them away so so easily now, although my pores are the ""same size"" (no change in appearance).  The fat reduction treatments have me a bit skeptical as I do not see any changes yet and under my chin is still pretty numb. My husband's skin is so clear and however his redness has just started returning the past few days. Overall very happy at this point.

**TLDR;** However, the procedures are incredibly painful but the results speak for themselves. I will be getting procedures done again my next visit to Seoul but at a different clinic with more transparent pricing.

1704896213.0,Skin oily after skincare,"Hi all, 
18 male here, I have normal skin type so I don‚Äôt produce a lot of oils. On the days when I feel lazy and perhaps don‚Äôt wash my face or only use water, cleanser and moisturiser my face is nice and matte. 

But anytime I make an attempt to improve my skin by adding more products, my T-zone, nose especially, gets really shiny and oily.

This is my current skincare routine, or the one I‚Äôm trying to stick to but get get oily:

AM
- don‚Äôt use cleanser, just wash with water

Toner - ANUA Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner

Serum - Anua Peach 70% Niacinamide Serum

Moisturiser - Cerave Daily Moisturising Lotion

SPF - Beauty of Joseon Relief Sun: Rice + Probiotic SPF50+

PM

Oil Cleanser - SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Light Cleansing Oil

Cleanser - CeraVe Foaming Cleanser for Normal to Oily Skin

Exfoliant - Paula‚Äôs Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant (every two days)

Toner - ANUA Heartleaf 77% Soothing Toner

Essence - MIXSOON Bean Essence

Serum - Anua Peach 70% Niacinamide Serum

Moisturiser - Cerave Daily Moisturising Lotion


My thoughts:
- My moisturiser is too thick maybe and it makes me look shiny
- The spf I use also makes me shiny and not matte although I heard good reviews online 
- I‚Äôve used different products but this problem has always happened when I try to make an effort in skincare my fave always gets oily and shiny


In terms of skin hydration I really can‚Äôt tell the difference between when my skin is hydrated or if products are making me oily. I like the feeling of toner and water, but hate the stickiness of the glow essence

Can anyone help with this, and don‚Äôt suggest blotting paper, cos I‚Äôm sure that the problem is stemming from a product",koreanskincare

I used only Alumier MD, Image Skincare (medical grade western products) and some of DECIEM The Ordinary, but found it didn‚Äôt help my skin anymore as I seemed to have reached a plateau. I washed twice daily with an oil cleanser, during the day applied HA serum and SPF moisturizer and at night an eye cream + 10% azelaic acid.  

I tried the following 10 steps routine (all at once after doing patch tests - I know this might have been a mistake!) since January 1st:

1. Heimish all clean balm oil cleanser 
2. Soonjung etude 5.5 foam cleanser
3. Bio-peel gauze peeling green tea (twice a week)
4. Pyunkang Yul essence toner 
5. I‚Äôm from Mugwort essence 
6. Cosrx propolis light ampoule 
7. Real nature hydrating masks (every other day)
8. Benton fermentation eye cream
9. Pyunkang Yul calming moisture barrier cream
10. Coola sun silk SPF 30 drops

I also got a LED EMS wand that I used twice on the red light setting after applying a hydrating mask. 

I absolutely LOVE doing the routine, it‚Äôs almost therapeutic, but my skin flares up after and I‚Äôm scared this isn‚Äôt normal! I feel it happens after the toner / essence stage. 

First pic - January 1st before starting 
Second pic - January 6th after morning routine (I got scared and washed my face again to remove the products)
Third pic - January 6th mid day

HELP ME!!!! Is it a normal ¬´¬†purge¬†¬ª initial stage or there‚Äôs something wrong here? Even if I researched them before, is there any products that I use in my routine that could trigger flare ups?

I've read articles, watched tik tok videos, and read through skincare subs such as this to gather as much info as I can. I have to admit it has been overwhelming, but also very exciting on this journey of self care. 

 I'm trying to create a good list of reputable Korean skincare retailers that will ship to the U.S. The below is what I have gathered so far. The reason for this post is two fold:

1)  Can you take a look at the below list and add any I might have missed, and/or share which ones you have had the best experience with, best shipping speeds, and/or best sales and deals. 

2) I have very sensitive, very dry skin, with rosacea redness. When my skin gets irritated, my rosacea flares causing a few hives, these hives turn into little whiteheads the next day, if left untreated they turn into scars. I am however not acne prone. This only happens with rosacea flares when some product doesn't agree with me/stress/other irritant. Do you have any holy grail product recommendations for my skin type? I also find that my skin needs mild exfoliation more frequently or it just starts to look very dull. Although I only try to exfoliate 1-2x a week, something gentle that can still keep me radiant on a more frequent basis could help me. 

If you've read this far, thank you so much! Below is the retailers list I've compiled:

*Olive & Young
*Jolse
*Soko Glam
*Style Korean
*Yes Style
*Blooming Koco
*Live K-Beauty
*Olive Kollection

I have tried the some by mi moisturizer as well and love the texture but I noticed that when I used other acne treatments with it that it‚Äôd break me out.

1704044654.0,Skincare routine,"I just wanted to post my skincare routine on here to ask confirm if everything is in the right (recommended) order. Recently started getting into Korean skincare, have always had pretty dry skin and not prone to Acne or breakouts, maybe a pimple here or there. I do have some little bumps on the forehead and some black/whiteheads on the nose that I want to get rid of. I haven‚Äôt received all my products yet so this is my current skincare routine.

&#x200B;

**current**:

facewash: neutrogena ultra gentle daily cleanser

toner: tirtir milk skin 

essence: cosrx snail muccin (I wait a little bit before putting it on after my toner)

serum: vitamin c dr althea

eye gel/cream: (**i Got this from urban outfitters lol)** byoma vita c eye gel 

***wait a little bit***

moisturizer: Olay active hydration

sunscreen: Etude 

&#x200B;

***my skincare routine when I receive the rest of my products***

***MORNING***

facewash: same as before

toners: Anua heartleaf, Isntree hyaluronic acid, Tirtir milk 

***wait***

essence: same as before

serums: anua peach niacinamide, **WAIT** dr Althea vitamin c serum

eye gel/cream: same as before

moisturizer: same as before

sunscreen: same 

&#x200B;

(**ig my main concern here is the hyaluronic acid toner before the niacinamide and vita c serums. (If its okay to use in that order**) Also ik using both niacinamide and vita c can sometimes have bad effects but thats why when layering, im gonna wait a while in between those two serums. I don‚Äôt really wanna do alternating days.)

&#x200B;

my **current** night routine is the same as my **current** morning routine except without sunscreen

(my night routine once the rest of my products come in would hopefully be the same as what my morning routine would be, except that I would double cleanse with *kose speedy oil cleanser* and wouldnt use the vitamin c serum or eye gel. Just the niacinamide serum along with a *retinal eye cream (beauty of Joseon).*   


and going back to the little bumps I have on my forehead, **I was wondering if the anua heart leaf toner would be enough to get rid of the minor texture I have.** Because I wanted an exfoliating toner but not a super harsh one and I heard that the anua had exfoliating properties that were gentle for everyday use. I debated between the anua and the some by mi miracle toner but got anua as it seemed less harsh.

as for the black/whiteheads on my nose I think the oil cleanser should help with that hopefully.

1703992633.0,Where To Buy Skincare (Price Comparison),"So I‚Äôve recently gotten into Korean skin care and one thing I‚Äôve noticed is the lack of availability in the states. Obviously this isn‚Äôt completely shocking, considering Korea is over six thousand miles away. Still in our modern world it is so hard to find legit sellers for these products in a time where anyone can sell anything online.

I live in a fairly big city, so I have had the luxury of getting my items in person up until this point. But this solution still has its faults, most notably: lack of selection and overpricing products. (For overpricing the example I give is the Madagascar Centella Hyalu-Cica Water-Fit Sun Serum which on average sells for around 8 dollars across the board was priced at 20 dollars). 

The only other option left is shopping online. I have spent a while looking for reputable stores where I wouldn‚Äôt accidentally end up with a counterfeit (Amazon). The places I have found are: Oliveyoung, yesstyle, stylevana, and jolse. 

I wanted to compare these stores and settled on yesstyle and stylevana mostly due to oliveyoung‚Äôs lack of variety and constant supply issues, and no jolse because I‚Äôm a bit lazy.

I have exactly 18 products in my cart, all the exact same products. I also applied easily found codes for each site, the price comparison above.

Both of these websites can be known for their delays in shipping. Yesstyle has an estimate of January 14th, while Stylevana gives no estimate. I will note that for both carts 17 ideas listed that they ship in 1 to 2 days. While yesstyle had one product that ships in 7 to 14 days, and stylevana has one product that ships in 14 to 21 days.

For transparency sake I have shopped with yesstyle before and never had a problems with their shipping. But if you have shopped from either or both stores let me know your experience below. I‚Äôd like to know how you guys are feeling in terms of pricing and shipping.

I'm new to skincare,"My skin type is oily/combination and I suffer from acne prone skin and I have extremely uneven skin texture, enlarged pores, closed comedones and some dark spots on my cheek. Also I have lots of hyperpigmentation, especially around my mouth area. 

My AM routine is just use 'get your greens' cleanser by a brand called ""put simply""
And then afterwards apply moisturizer (Neutrogena).      

And my PM routine is the same 'get your greens' cleanser, then COSRX aha/bha toner, then beauty of joseon calming green tea serum and then I seal it all with my moisturizer. 

Is there anything I should do? not do? add anything else?  

I've been using this routine for maybe 2 months and i feel like cosrx aha/bha toner is the only one doing the work. The serum i got recommended by the person who sold it to me said it would ""calmy my acne"" and keep me hydrated and stuff but idk.., and my cleanser is definitely a good one but it only removes dirt and i just feel like i need a more exfoliating cleanser

1691032789.0,Lamiche vs. Ever Skin Clinic in Seoul,"Hi! I'm going to Seoul next month and am trying to decide between two skin care clinics.

Lamiche ""Club Miz""

Ever Skin Clinic

Both of these seem rated highly on Kakao and Naver, which means they're known and respected by locals (which is great!).

What I'm trying to understand is whether the cost will be comparable between the two.

I'd like to get 1-2 laser treatments (vBeam, Excel V, or Synergy MPX) for acne redness and melasma.

I'd also like to get 1-2 procedures for my double chin (inMode or injection).

Also 3 facial moles removed.

I've reached out to them both about price but they only answered a few of my price questions.Ever Skin Clinic said 275,000 won for 1 laser treatment + 11,000 per mole. Lamiche just said 330,000 for 1 laser treatment, but then jumps to 5 laser treatments costing 257,000 won for each laser treatment.

1686088388.0,Should I cancel my Stylevana order?,"I usually check my sources.  I've ordered from YesStyle, Oliveyoung, KoreaDepart, Dokodemo (Japan), StyleKorean, and BeautynetKorea.  I've never had any issues. It's always clear how items are shipped, if I have to pay for shipment and if I will have to pay for import fees.

I saw that Stylevana was having a sale, and Dr. Dray had recommended products from them, so I didn't do my due diligence. I am seeing terrible reviews everywhere that orders are still processing a month after. I also (and this is my fault) ordered one product that won't be available for 30 days.

I reached out to their customer service, and they reached back (I guess they don't work weekends, but I cannot get mad at that.) Their automated response still said that things were slow due to Labor Day.  Hrrm, that was May 1st, and I wrote to you in June. This echoed what I had read in a lot of reviews by then.  I asked them to remove the one product so my order could ship. I just checked, and my order is still processing with the Beta-Glucan product (the one that needs to go) in my order.

How long would you give them, and would you try to get your money back from their customer service or your bank? (I used a credit card via Paypal to pay).  I always expect around a month to receive my products in Canada when ordering from Korea or Hong Kong. That way, I'm usually pleasantly surprised!

I was told it was free delivery with Stylevana, and I had to pay $ 38$ (I took regular mail insured).  I'm glad I took this insurance now... if my products ever get out of their processing state.

I plan to wait another week, and if things are still processing, I will start the cancellation procedures. I'm sad because that Oat skin is something that I wanted before beginning Tret! I am also out of my beloved PKY essence. (Yes, that's entirely my fault).

What is your opinion, Korean skincare lovers? If I get this order, I will stick to the trusty websites. This was an ''it's the last few days of May, and that sale will be over soon- better order now.'' impulse buy.  I want everything that I ordered.  I'm just mad at myself for taking an influencer's word for it without doing my research first (that is also 100% my fault).

Are you getting your SV orders? Did they get better since the slew of negative reviews?

EDIT: I just emailed their customer service AGAIN.  Here is a copy of what I sent them with specific info redacted: (sent 6/8/2023 at 4:30 pm est time).

Order #BWSV.......

Your agent said they would remove the item listed below as it's a 30-day item, and my order would be shipped.

ColorNMillilitre15mlOrdered: 1Unit Price: CA$12.83

My order is still processing.¬† I order a lot from Korea and Hong Kong.¬† This is not normal.¬† If my order has yet to ship by June 15, I will do a chargeback.

Respectfully

Plo83

Edit: 6/14/2023

I just received a tracking number. My order has left today according to this. It took 15 days and a few emails to get SV to ship my order. I have never waited that long for an order, and I should consider myself lucky since some people ordered at the beginning of May and are still waiting.  I will be lucky if I get my order and no products are close to expiring. I will NOT be ordering from SV again.

Some people claim that they never had an issue with them, and I believe them. When ordering from SV, it's the toss of a coin deciding your fate. I will shop with reputable companies that have never let me down before. This is the first not-so-positive experience I've had when ordering from anywhere in Asia. Most services are professional and work to fix any issues rapidly. SV has been the exception.

Edit: This will be my last edit. I received my order. Everything was there. It was well packaged.

That said, my messages were ignored, and my order was ''processing'' for over two weeks. When I emailed giving them a few more days before a chargeback, my order changed status rapidly, and things started moving. Things went quickly from then on.

SV has severe internal issues if you check the reviews. They need to stop spending on influencers and publicity to fix their problems. If I ever order from them again, it will be because I cannot find a product elsewhere, and the order will be for a meagre amount. I won't place a 300$ order again, that's for sure. That way, if my order takes three months, I won't be sweating and praying that I either get my goods or my money back.

From my own experience, I cannot call them a scam, as I've received my items. It's still the worst customer service and ordering process I've ever experienced from any website. I do not want to scare anyone away from ordering from HK or South Korea. I've ordered from many other websites before and only ever had pleasant experiences!",koreanskincare

1713039118.0,Wondering if this facial experience was normal?,"Hello! I tried out a new spa and I'm trying to figure out if I'm just being overdramatic or not. I normally get clear and brilliant laser somewhere else and had never had a traditional facial before.

When I signed up for the facial via class pass I received zero instructions and wasn't asked anything about my skin/history. The website of the spa doesn't say anything about preparing about this particular facial either. Since I didn't sign up for any peels or anything intense, but out of caution I stopped my tretinoin and my vitamin c about 3-4 days before to prevent excess irritation just in case. 

I walked into the spa room & was asked if I wanted champagne, and I said no because I don't really care for drinking, especially at 1 pm. **She kept asking me until I said yes.** She said that it was Saturday and that I should relax, which I get to an extent, but it was definitely weird. When she got it for me, she awkwardly stood there while I drank half of it and then I set it down.

Now, I have very clear skin that I've worked very hard towards and I definitely stare at it way too much, so I know where I have congestion, a few superficial whiteheads, and where I don't. I also know the difference between sebaceous filaments and blackheads, but it doesn't seem like this esthetician did. She worked with a very heavy grip on my face. It has been multiple hours since this facial and everywhere she worked is still very red and sore. My skin was mostly smooth and any congestion was not noticeable before walking into this spa. Now my face is very noticeably red and swollen and my nose is throbbing. The neck/shoulder massage was okay, but she massaged my face after the extractions, which hurt and all of the skincare she used really stung the open wounds on my face. She also left a clay mask on for so long that it dried out my skin and felt uncomfortable. Eventually, she washed if off, put on some serums that stung again, thanked me, and **told me not to wear sunscreen** after my facial. 

At the front counter she told me that my skin is too oily for moisturizer (I have dry skin) and that I should try this cleanser, which after looking at the ingredients is made out of **essential oils** and a $60 hyaluronic acid serum with no ingredient list. She also told me that she couldn't use vitamin c on my face today because I use prescription skincare (I use vitamin c every morning with no irritation while using tret) and that next time I should stop for two weeks beforehand, which doesn't make sense if I'm not doing anything other than steaming, extractions, and a face/head/neck massage.

I got home, and I looked in the mirror again and **I still have a few superficial whiteheads** after she squeezed my face so hard that its been hurting for multiple hours! Those should have been the easiest to get rid of. This spa has hundreds of five star reviews on class pass, yelp, and google. I did careful research beforehand and I feel like I accidentally went to an awful place by the same name. I can't tell if I'm being overdramatic or if I'm right to be disappointed. I gave her a full tip because I felt awkward doing anything less and didn't want to give class pass clients a bad rep for not tipping well. I was so excited for this and I'm trying not to be sad.",Skincare_Addiction

1712863448.0,Any advice is welcome,"About 6 years ago, I fell for this deal to get laser treatment done to my face.   I had a lot of issues related to health problems from previous years, and I was hoping that getting the laser would help... they made so many promises of the ""benefits"". 

 At the time, I was often mistaken for being honestly 20 years younger than I was.  It was nice, I still had the fullness in my face and literally no wrinkles.  

 I went in for my treatment, had numbed my face first, with numbing cream.   The person who did the laser treatment really turned up the heat.  It was heating the dermis and the subdermis, quite a lot.   Then as I'm leaving, they began to hard sell me for deals to pay for the next treatment.    That money is gone forever.

I went home, and didn't expect to anything but positive results.   Over the weeks and months, my face began to change in ways that horrified me.    I discovered the intense heat they had put into my face, had caused the death of the fat cells in my face - cell aptosis.   Suddenly, I just didn't even look like myself anymore.  And when I touched my face, all I felt was BONE, all over.  It was horrifying.  The skin became loose, and that looseness went South, into my neck.  The absolute worst.   Any expression I made would pile up skin, making rows of lines along the upper cheeks and on the forehead.  I always had a very smooth forehead with no expression lines, at least not horizontal ones.  

I suddenly had all this loose skin,  with nothing to support it anymore - major loss of volume.   That youthful look was definitely out the door.  

They also went really hard core over the corners of my mouth, so now there are divots there, and it makes it look like my mouth is drooping at the corners.   When I do my makeup, I have to do so much highlighting to try to balance out all of the hollowed out stuff.  

Yesterday, I saw a picture of me just before the treatment and then after, it was really interesting to see how small and angular my face had become.  

 I tried fillers, mainly so I could stand to look at myself.  I found them to be traumatic to get, and scary, because of the risks of losing your vision.  I just don't have any money for maintaining that.   You have to keep getting them, and over time they can really make your face start to get distorted.   I was told I needed fat transfer, but that costs thousands of dollars.  

I tried a variety of things, but over time my skin has developed a really pronounced, orange peel texture.  

I added a picture of just a small section of my cheek area.   

I was just wondering if anyone has any advice?  Something I can do that isn't expensive, but might improve the problem.    This isn't normal aging for me, it came on rapidly after that horrible laser treatment.  I have spoken to others online who had the same type of laser treatments, and the same type of results.  They were just as devastated as I was.  

Thank God I didn't go back for more treatments, they kept telling me I just needed to get more and it would look better.  Absolutely ridiculous.  I would have ended up looking like Skeletor.  

 If I had the money, I would honestly get a lower face/neck lift, but I will never be able to do that.  

 I currently have to wear a lot of sunblock if I go out, because I am a transplant patient.  Been doing that for many years, so I get minimal sun on my face.   I have done a lot of the common things you can do at home, like glycolic peels and microneedling, plus serums and such.    I haven't done a peel in a really long time. It's just kind of hard to affect something that goes so deep.   I also do facial exercise regularly, which helps a little bit.  ",Skincare_Addiction

for exfoliants I purchased the Paulas choice BHA liquid 2% travel sized, my second night using it and I woke up with my skin feels soft. if all continues to go well I will def purchase the bigger size.

eye cream I use good molecules Yerba mate gel. 

moisturizer I use byoma moisturizing rich cream (im almost out so idk if I want to repurchase or try something new) 

any moisturizing recommend for oily skin should I continue with cream or try gel moisturizers ? 

how should I layer these products so I don't cause any irritation between ingredients

should I add any products or replace to achieve clear skin I want to brighten, fade scars, maintain acne and fix texture?

are any of the products im using useless? 

I been doing my research as well but I am getting confused but don't want to give up. my skin isn't awful but there's things I want to fix.

Usually have some sort of little breakout going on, pretty clear right now but with age I'm realizing I can't ignore general skincare anymore and don't know where to start.

Current routine is slim:

* Reusable makeup remover rags (should probably change that?)
* Cerave hydrating facial cleanser
* Cerave PM facial lotion anytime (AM dries out my skin)
* Sunscreen (Neutrogena Clear Face) in AM if I'm going outside
* Argan oil at night for most of the past like 10 years

Rarely I'll use witch hazel if my skin feels dirty, I know I need a better option for that.

My nose is terribly dry everywhere, but especially in the crevices gets flakey and always red. Pores are always clogged, and again I usually have at least 1 big blemish somewhere. I'm buying serums as l have none, there are just so many that I don't know which ones would be the most effective for me. All I know is Ordinary's hyaluronic and glycolic acids are being raved about so l have those in my cart.

1712768441.0,Accutane + Tretinoin Success Story,"Hi everyone, success stories were my lifeline when my acne was at its worst, so I wanted to share mine. For context, I‚Äôm only wearing sunscreen in the first photo. 

I‚Äôve struggled with severe acne for about 6 years, but experienced acne since the beginning of high school, until the end of my bachelors degree (so 8 years total). 

It‚Äôs been 2 years since I completed 9 months of Accutane which was a miracle for me. It drastically reduced the amount of new break outs I was getting. As far as clearing up acne goes, I give Accutane full credit because I was on Differin Gel for 8 months, then used Tretinoin for nearly 2 years prior to taking Accutane. I had also tried countless antibiotics, birth control pills, and facials in an effort to reduce my acne. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Accutane is a hardcore drug that left my eyes insanely dry and itchy. My joints hurt to this day, but it was worth it. 

After Accutane, I still occasionally broke out and my face was covered in scars. I decided to give Tretinoin another try, but I heard that the cream may not be acne-prone friendly. Since I used Tretinoin before for a pretty extensive period of time, I was able to jump straight into daily use of 0.1% Retin-A Gel. 

To this day, I use a very similar nightly routine that I followed while on Accutane:
1. Albolene if I‚Äôm wearing eye makeup
2. Dove unscented beauty bar 
3. Tretinoin on damp skin (I know that many people find this very irritating but I love how easy it is to rub it in‚Ä¶)
4. For a while I used Cerave in the tub, but it just wasn‚Äôt moisturizing enough for me. I moved onto Vanicream, but it left my skin flaky in the mornings. Still less flaky than Cerave. I recommend Vanicream to anyone with active breakouts, because I currently use Nivea in the glass tub. In the past, I felt like it would break me out but right now it‚Äôs the only cost effective cream that leaves me glowy and dewy. I‚Äôm not encouraging anyone to use it, it just works for me.

In the mornings, I just slap on sunscreen. I don‚Äôt have a favorite yet but I really dislike any Cetaphil sunscreens. 

I hope to stick to this routine forever, because whenever I stray away from it and add another active, I wake up to 7 new breakouts instantly.",Skincare_Addiction

Due to all this I have experienced like a dent like a visible hollow not like the general hollow eyes but like a hole in which things can fit now like a drop of water can be held like a container .. not explaining properly but it is like that..
The doctor said that due to abuse with a lot of steroid tretinion etc creams the skin has dried out and no hydration etc and the rubbing has caused that hole or dent because of some fat pad has moved and the volume there is break down he said only option is filler cause laser will irritate and then mrf because of ice pick scars and overall texture brightening cause now there is no glow on face and has turned very dull and dark

I know 99% that I cannot reverse the the fat pad loss but does anyone know if it is possible naturally like any thing helps with this I really don't want to go the filler way but I am also depressed at how old this makes me look
I have so many lines steroid darkness and now hollowing with very deep tear trough lines so much of me tells to just do it but then I also read a lot of comments on this forum how people regret all these treatments in long term fillers and even mnrf causing more fat and volume loss

Any suggestions please I am already depressed and always in front of mirror feeling hopeless with life but don't have guts to do these treatments

Hello everyone,   

35 M   

In the last three weeks, I've been taking care of my facial skin  again, so I did some research and watched some videos/feedbacks/youtube  etc.   

But since I started using these products, something is different, on  the negative side. Because I notice that I have a lot more acne, small  red spots, and whiteheads in the nose area, and two of them haven't gone  away (left marks, didn't squeeze) even after two weeks.   

I have the feeling that the Cerave lotion (Blue package) is not  working very well for me, probably I need to use a moisturizer that is  for combination skin (dry and oily in the T-zone).   

I also noticed that my dark circles are much worse (I use all the  products in the eye area), I would also like you to help me indicate a  good product for dark circles, and I don't rule out makeup, but it  should be something very discreet.   

After waking up:   

&#x200B;

* Cerave hydrating cleanser     
 
* Shave     
 
* Uriage - thermal water     
 
* Nivea super sensitive skin after shave

I just want to send a friendly reminder to whoever needs it, your acne doesn't define you, stop all the lotions and potions and following skincare trends, I promise you they don't work. Your skin type is unique so please treat it with what it needs, not what influences are promoting.

Hope this gives a glimmer of hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel!!! xxx",Skincare_Addiction

Hi Im 29F and currently working at a call center. Our account only works night shifts. Im quite a begginer in skincare. 

I have my face darker than my neck. I have dark spots and oily skin. Also large pores. Currently im using glaycolic and salicylic acid. Ive been doing this for 3 mos now and i dont think im seeing any improvement. 

I only wanted my face to get lighter and less oily and smaller pores. 

I see on internet that salicylic should only be used at night and stuff like that and i dont know anymore if im doing it right.! 

How should I do my skin care routine on this?  Please help.

1712509296.0,HELP: How do I explain this to my boyfriend,"Hi guys.

Before I explain, trigger warninf for a very very bad skin practices.

I am writing this out today because my boyfriend revealed his shocking routine today and I am not yet well versed enough to explain to him that what he has been doing over the couple of months is very questionable to say the least.

He has been experimenting with minoxidil for his beard and I truly support him if it's going to give him more confidence. I wasn't paying much attention to it except that he puts it on in the morning and evening and we cannot kiss or mush faces together.

I asked him today what his routine entails and he says that he puts the product on, sometimes uses microneedle roller and also uses retinol as he heard it helps with the effect. I was kinda taken aback with the roller as I know it's not really a good idea to use it especially with actives that can irritate skin and also knowing him he probably doesn't wash his face before.

I asked him if he knows that the roller can spread bacteria around his whole face if he doesn't wash his face and the roller properly beforehand. He said that I am a silly goose for thinking he is not prepared, because before he rolls his face he uses propylalcohol to spray his face down and the roller.

I was shocked at that. 

Honestly I am not very good at giving reasons why what he is doing is extremely irritable to his skin (not really sure how he has not broke out like crazy, my man's having better skin than me). I told him that the minoxidil is irritant on its own, couples with a 3% retinol is vile and that the straight up alcohol is going to dry him out. He's been doing this for months now. To be fair, he does this roller thing every 3 days, not everyday.

Can someone please give me an explanation of why what he is doing is dangerous so I can properly educate him on this? And or maybe if this is actually good, how? How come I spend hundreds of dollars and hours watching skincare advice, having a solid morning and evening routine and still have worse skin than this man?",Skincare_Addiction

 I panicked and I tried cleaning off the tube on the outside because now it was super sticky. Again tried soap and it was still sticky and made my hands super sticky.

1712475502.0,Skincare actually making my skin worse?,"Skincare just making my skin worse?

Im 28 years old and did not take care of my face, like, ever, before now. I washed my makeup (i use only eyebrow gel) but did nothing more for years, and had no problems with my face. Now i have been including daily skincare to my selfcare routine, but after a couple of months of using my products, i think my skin is only getting worse. Some days my cheeks are red, i think im getting more pimples than i used to and most of all i think the skin on my face is not as even as it used to be.. (I have been doing my evening routine for about 4 months now, morning routine for over a month - products below)

I have similar, bad skincare experience with my hands too. I have started using hand lotion before going to bed, just to add some extra to my evening routine. There was nothing wrong with my hands, they were not dry or anything BUT after using lotion daily, they have become very dry, and making my skin break more easily. The skin on my hands just feels weird after using lotions. 

Whats the point of this all if it only makes my skin worse? Is it really just the whole fkng industry that makes our skin addicted to the products, to make us buy even more, or are my products just not suitable for my skin? And if that is so, what should i change/take off, where should i start? Or should i just quit? I have used a LOT of money on these products, and would not want to change them all just to try if some other expencive little bottle would work for me better.. Honestly im thinking of ending this all, but it has become an essential part of my daily selfcare, and would hate to say goodbye to my lovely routine..

My morning routine:
- Q+A vitamin c serum
- Urtekram ageless day cream

My evening routine:
- Mossa juicy clean, purifying creme-mousse
- The ordinary niacinamide 10% serum

(I‚Äôm not sure what my skin type is. I think its mixed, sometimes its just a bit dry but if it gets dry, it gets oily after that. So i would say mixed or a bit oily, but because i‚Äôm not sure, i have been using only products that are listed to ‚Äùall skin types.‚Äù)

I'm pretty new to skincare as a whole and have been working on learning ingredients and getting the specific brands/serums for the results I want. My routine is pretty simple and I am trying to find a niacinamide serum to settle on. 

I like the consistency and feel of both the Glow Recipe Niacinamide Dew Drops and the Good Molecules Discoloration Correcting Serum. I've been using the Good Molecules serum for the last month and like the results so far. But I wanted to branch out into different brands. Since I don't like layering serums, I've been sticking to a niacinamide one as my main serum, but which works better? I tried to look at the ingredients, but I only understand what they are and not how the amounts of them are factoring into my product. 

Which one would help most with my goal of evening out my skin tone and getting rid of dark spots? Any advice would be great in helping me pick between them. Thanks!

1712278162.0,Microneedling scarred my skin,"I have no reason to write this post but to inform anyone who's considering it to think carefully before jumping onto the microneedling bandwagon.

I got my 1st (and only) session done 2 months ago per my dermatologist's suggestion as a solution to slightly enlarged pores on my cheeks. My session was fairly light, I didn't feel much pain and the recovery entailed no peeling or any major redness. I didn't suffer throughout the process and was actually excited about the potential results.

Fast forward to a few weeks post-procedure, I notice a skin-colored formless bump (only lightly raised) on my nose. It was like a little flesh-colored flattened island. 

Then, I decided to shine a flashlight across my face to create some shadows and investigate that bump further, when I suddenly found track grooves all across my face: cheeks, temples, chin. I also noticed other ""flattened islands"" on my cheeks. 

The skin was scarred and worse off then when I started. I'm devastated. You can't see it much if you're not increasing the lighting contrast around my face with a flashlight, but it's enough for me to realize that it's caused some damage to fairly healthy, young (33 y/o) skin.

I have an appt with the dermatologist soon and will keep you posted on what to expect from now on.

If anybody else has experienced the same, I'd love to know and feel less alone in this. It's really been affecting my self esteem.

Tldr: got 1 micro-needling session done and regret it immensely

Edit: The procedure was done 2 months ago, not 4 as I previously thought (just revisited my phone pics for accurate timing)

‚Äî

UPDATE (10 MONTHS):

There is DEFINITELY light at the end of the tunnel! 
*you can find photos of my original issue in a comment below*

A little context: For months after that procedure, I began getting a crazy amount of acne. I was used to getting the usual pre-period pimples that were cystic, hurt a lot but never really surfaced, but these were more aggressive and much more spread out. I'd have at least 4-5 active pimples constantly (which was not the case before microneedling) and they'd show up on random places like my forehead (which was random for my usual pimple experience).

I started treating the pimples and in the process, I feel like I exfoliated my skin enough over time that the texture seems MUCH better now 10 months later. It's a slow process but hang in there! 

My routine included an acne soap that contained zinc, benzoyl peroxide 10% (I can handle this well) and azelaic acid at night (which is the most underrated acid in the universe imo). I didn't use the azelaic acid every night‚ÄîI kept it to ~3x a week.
For sun protection, I relied a lot on my heavy duty hats because my skin was sensitive. I stayed indoors a lot so I didn't always lather in sunscreen but I absolutely always wore a hat when outside.

My texture improved over time but if you're being sold on more microneedling so you can ""see improvement after more sessions,"" I would highly encourage you to think twice in case you already had a bad reaction to the first session like I did. 

Hope this helps!",Skincare_Addiction

1712262616.0,Have You Given Up on the Skincare Industry? I Have.. Kinda,"I‚Äôm in my 30‚Äôs and I have dry skin which has led me to spending a good amount of money the last three years buying different types of moisturizers, cleansers, serums and more to benefit my skin. I‚Äôve also dabbled in buying several collagen and peptide products because they claim to make a difference and prevent/repair age lines etc. 

I don‚Äôt really have any major skin concerns other than maintaining moisture, but I used to look for things that claim to prevent aging because I didn‚Äôt feel it would hurt to take preventative measures.

Now that I‚Äôve done research on ingredients, I‚Äôve cut down on spending and minimized my skincare routine to 5 things:

1. Castile bar soap
2. Exfoliating glove
3. Jojoba oil
4. Sweet Almond oil‚Ä¶ may switch to Apricot 
5. Either the Weleda Baby Cream or the Palmers Vitamin E Concentrate Skin Barrier Repair Moisturizer.

I don‚Äôt wash my skin everyday to prevent excessive dryness. When I moisturize my face I dampen my skin with water and massage 1 or 2 oils on my face, neck and chest. I make sure to spend a minute or two gently massaging the under eye area, smile line area and my forehead to let the oils get deeper into the skin. 
If don‚Äôt use oils and need to use a cream to avoid the excessive shine the oils create, I‚Äôll use one of the moisturizers that I mentioned.

I no longer spend money on anything that claims to be a ‚Äúmiracle repair‚Äù product or markets themselves as ‚Äúanti-aging‚Äù, contain to have peptides/collagen etc. I don‚Äôt but exfoliating products because an exfoliating glove lasts longer and can be purchased in bulk, which I have done.

Jojoba oil has many benefits for the skin since it contains Ceramides and is very similar to the skins sebum. It also absorbs easily and is practically free of any scent. There are also other oils that can even benefit **OILY skin** as well, like *dry oils*.

DON‚ÄôT LET THESE SKINCARE BRANDS FOOL YOU WITH THEIR FALSE PROMISES AND MARKETING SCHEMES. Yes, some brands offer great products but many are just cash grabs. 


Please research the ingredients in the products you use and the benefits of natural ingredients like carrier oils.

1712253734.0,Tiny bumps all over cheeks and forehead,"Hey guys!

So i started developing these really weird tiny bumps all over my skin about 5 months ago - i‚Äôve tried nizarol to get rid of them but that hasn‚Äôt been successful. my skin is super dry and sensitive. my current routine is:

AM: 
- etude whip cleanser 
- curel intense moisturiser 
- altruist spf 

PM:
- etude whip cleanser 
- purito centella unscented toner 
- on week 3 of medik 8 crystal retinal so have just started applying every other day 
- curel intense moisturiser 

I am really struggling at the moment trying to find a way to get rid of them  as they‚Äôve been on my skin for so long! i also just want to add in wearing a very light weight skin tint (glossier) in these photos which if anything have made the bumps more visible. it‚Äôs really weird because they don‚Äôt feel bumpy and at just under my skin. i started using retinal as read online this was really good for increasing cell turnover. About a month ago i stopped using paula‚Äôs choice BHA as it wasn‚Äôt doing anything for my skin and i thought these bumps may be from a compromised skin barrier so really simplified my skincare routine. however it‚Äôs been over a month now and they still seem to be there. 

anything to suggest what i should start using or to just stick it out with my retinal?

i‚Äôve also heard that glycolic acid could work so maybe should try and incorporate that into my skincare with once a week? 

Thank you!!!",Skincare_Addiction

","My skin currently looks great, and I don't want to screw it up. We have no power or hot water and won't for at least a couple days due to a storm.

Without warm water to wash my hands (and I pet a very oily cat before leaving the animal shelter I work at), would I just be upping my chance of acne by washing my face?

I‚Äôm 27 and have always had very dry skin, with eczema around my eyes and mouth. My forehead is clog prone.

1. Cleanse with The Ordinary Squalane cleanser (side question - should I be using a second cleanser after this? It washes off completely and my skin seems to like it). 

2. Once face is dry I go in with the Cerave retinol resurfacing serum. My skin really likes this. 

3. Once it has soaked it, I‚Äôll moisturise using Nivea cream. 

4. Then I use LRP cicaplast baume on my nose and cheeks, which are very damaged at the minute. For my eczema, I use Vaseline on my eyes and mouth area.

1712145142.0,[routine help] the bane of my forehead,"

Hey! 
So my skin has always been weird in that whenever I do nothing to it it looks great (and I mean nothing)- no breakouts or spots, maybe some bumps under my eyes that I think are called millia? But the second I try a skincare routine, even if it‚Äôs nothing but wetting my face and then putting moisturiser on, it all goes to hell. When that happens I stop using anything until it goes back to normal‚Ä¶and then I tend to try again cause I don‚Äôt want the products to go to waste (dumb I know)

Sometime last year I tried again and used an expired (I didn‚Äôt notice at the time) vitamin C serum that I think caused this nasty reaction on my forehead. I got these little bumps/rash that itches like crazy and then got crusty/scabby and itched more. In the end I cut some bangs so I wouldn‚Äôt see it and stop picking at it. It cleared up to the point that it‚Äôs not itchy anymore, BUT it is VERY dry and flaky and will react negatively to anything other than Vaseline. I also have dry patches like that on an eye lid? 

Me being a dumbass, did a face mask (made of rice idk it was sticky) last night and now it‚Äôs back to being red. Not itching or dry and flaky, just red and raised, and I figured I could ask and see if anyone knows wtf it is or how to get rid of it. I do plan to see a dermatologist at some point but it just hasn‚Äôt been possible yet.

Hope this makes sense and would really appreciate any advice!!

1712113471.0,Why should Vitamin c and Niacinamide serums not be used together ,"I've (23F) been using Vitamin c and niacinamide serums together since 2 years now. I first apply vitamin c and then after 5 mins I apply niacinamide followed by undereyecream and sunscreen.

When I was new to skincare life, I used to apply vitamin c in the morning and niacinamide in the evening 

This routine was built by me because I used to get those small bumps on my forehead which used to worse during summer.

Using these serums has helped me alot. Even now I don't seem to have a significant reaction on my skin other than occasional one pimple once in 2 months due to heat or periods.

I really don't know if using these two serums together will have long term effects. So please help me with the topic. Thank you.

1712073533.0,2 things to consider when choosing a dermatology in Korea,"I‚Äôm a local Korean 
Went to over 20 different clinics probably closer to 40 (consultations and medications included) to treat acne, acne scars, pigments, enlarged pores. I probably had procedures done at about 10 different clinics. 

I would like to share a bit of my personal experience after spending thousands of dollars  on so many different clinics to treat my acne prone skin and pigments. But keep in mind that this is just from my personal experience, but also‚Ä¶ these are just really basic things all Korean locals would consider before choosing a dermatology but I noticed that most foreigners don‚Äôt ‚Ä¶ 

1. Make sure the dermatology has board certified dermatologists
 - This is probably the most basic & important thing to consider because getting your skin treated at a ‚Äúdermatology‚Äù without board certified dermatologists is just like getting plastic surgery from a family physician or a doctor who isn‚Äôt a specialist in plastic surgery or going to a gynecology run by a non board certified dermatologist.
- I realized this after seeing less improvements, getting deeper scarring and receiving risky acne prescriptions from NON board certified dermatologies

2. Check the kind of laser machine they have (this is the SECOND most important thing not the first)
You need to make sure that the dermatology machines are being used by someone who specializes in dermatology!!!

1712004842.0,Looking for help with beginner routine,"Hello!! 
I‚Äôm very new to skincare so just looking for help building a good routine.

Here‚Äôs my current routine that I‚Äôve been doing for about two weeks now. 

PM: Farmacy green clean
Kiehl‚Äôs ultra facial cleanser
Naturium Retinol serum 1-2 times a week so far
Kiehl‚Äôs ultra facial cream

AM: Rinse with water 
Farmacy vitamin C (has been every day but considering slowing down a little because I‚Äôve noticed my moisturizer stings after applying it) 
Kiehl‚Äôs ultra facial cream
Supergoop unseen sunscreen 

My problems are hormonal acne, acne scars and dryness. 

I‚Äôm wondering if I should also be looking to add AHA/BHA? I‚Äôve heard they can compliment retinol to help with acne scarring.

1712004171.0,[Acne] How long does retinol purging last?,"Hi all. I've read online that it typically lasts for 6 weeks but can last even longer than that depending on a few things. I'm kinda confused tho. Does the 6 weeks start once you start using retinol regularly, or do the weeks when you use retinol once a week already count in the 6 weeks? I started using retinol  3 weeks ago and am in the process of purging. The first 2 weeks I was using it once a week, then just last week I increased it to twice a week. Does that mean I should expect to purge for 3 more weeks or do the first 3 weeks not count? ",Skincare_Addiction

1711804834.0,Advice needed: Post-inflammatory erythema (PIE) that is reoccurring,"Hi yall! I‚Äôve struggled with acne for years. I have seen several dermatologists and the solution is usually tretinoin or birth control. I regularly use tretinoin but have stopped birth control a little over a year ago. 

I get maybe 2 pimples per week dependent on hormone levels and it wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if they didn‚Äôt leave a red mark after they heal. So while I may have a pimple for 2 or 3 days, the red marks stay from 3 weeks to sometimes months. This makes my face look like I‚Äôm constantly having a huge acne breakout when I‚Äôm not really. 

I regularly use tretinoin and SkinCeuticals CE Ferulic. And I‚Äôve tried BBL and I get moxi laser treatments a few times per year. The problem with this is that the laser may remove the marks at first, they come back in a week after having the treatment because it‚Äôs a temporary fix. Then it feels like I wasted $700‚Ä¶..

1711778342.0,Is applying serum on pimples ok?,"Let's say i accidentally popped it open, so before applying a pimple patch I want to put some cos de baha (5% tranexamic, 5% niacinamide) on the pimple in order to reduce hyperpigmentation scars that may appear later on, as iirc the serum reduces the production/travel of melanin(?) to the skin surface? idk but it does reduce hyperpigmentation.

Is it ok to do so? If I wait for it to heal before doing so, it's less effective as most of the melanin(?) is produced in reaction to the wound, so applying during the healing process should reduce this drastically right?

1711744168.0,The Skincare Trap: Escaping the Cycle of Dependency,"I have been using skincare products since I can remember myself. I might get some hate for what I am about to say but I'm prepared to face the consequences. While many of us have been led to believe that these products are essential for achieving healthy, radiant skin, I stand before you to challenge this notion.

Let us consider for a moment the sheer number of skincare products available on the market today. From cleansers and toners to moisturizers and serums, the options seem endless. Yet, despite the multitude of choices, our society is plagued by an epidemic of skin issues such as acne, dryness, and sensitivity.

Why is this the case? I propose that skincare products themselves may be contributing to the very issues they claim to solve. Consider the ingredients found in these products‚Äîharsh chemicals, artificial fragrances, and preservatives, to name a few. These substances can strip the skin of its natural oils, disrupt its delicate balance, and even cause irritation and inflammation.

But perhaps even more concerning is the notion that skincare products may be creating a cycle of dependency. Just like any other addiction, our skin becomes accustomed to the constant influx of products, leading to a reliance on them for basic maintenance. This dependency not only undermines the skin's natural ability to regulate itself but also perpetuates a never-ending cycle of consumption.

Furthermore, let us not overlook the environmental impact of our obsession with skincare products. The beauty industry is notorious for its excessive use of plastic packaging, contributing to pollution and waste on a global scale. By perpetuating the myth that skincare products are necessary for healthy skin, we are not only harming ourselves but also the planet we call home.

So, what is the solution? It is time for us to reevaluate our relationship with skincare products and prioritize simplicity over excess. Instead of relying on a multitude of products to achieve perfect skin, we should focus on nourishing our bodies from the inside out‚Äîthrough a healthy diet, proper hydration, and adequate sun protection.

In conclusion, I urge you to question the status quo and challenge the notion that skincare products are the answer to all our skincare woes. Let us embrace our natural beauty and work towards a more sustainable and holistic approach to skincare‚Äîone that promotes health, not dependency.

Thank you.",Skincare_Addiction

1711647567.0,Skin feel better but look worse,"Hi, so I just started using skincare more consistently and has built up a simple routine. My skin immediately feel better (more hydrated, softer and plump) but after around 2 weeks my skin also began to look worse (more pimples and redness).
The weird thing is that my skin still feel smooth to the touch and the pimples don‚Äôt really hurt, they‚Äôre just red and make my skin more textured. This has been going on for another 2 weeks, so around a month of this new skincare routine. 
Is this purging? Is it just my hormones? If anyone has a similar experience, please give me some advice. I‚Äôve search the internet but nothing comes up.

Then when i had my newborn i was sleep deprived and tired so i stopped using any products on my skin and since then i never had acne.

For some context, my skin used to be pretty good until I switched to the nexplanon birthcontrol since then, my skin has been consistently breaking out. I used to have bad acne when I was in HS so there is some scarring. 

I have started seeing an aesthetician and have had two salicylic acid peels done on my back. This has helped a bit with scarring, but I‚Äôm more concerned about my face right now. I have an appointment booked with a dermatologist for May 17th. 

I USED to use strictly cerave products, the list is as follows;
1.) Hydrating micellar water (Still use to take makeup off).
2.) Hydrating cream to foam cleanser for dry to normal skin.
3.) Hydrating serum with hyaluronic acid.
4.) Renewing SA lotion.

I stopped using these because I found it dried my skin out insanely, and made my issues worse. My aesthetician has me using the following currently in this order;

AM CARE
1.) AlumierMD Acne Clarifying Cleanser
2.) AlumierMD Acne Balancing Serum
3.) AlumierMD HydraClarit√© Moisturizer

PM CARE
1.) Cerave Hydrating micellar water (To remove makeup if I wear any that day)
1.) AlumierMD Acne Clarifying Cleanser
2.) AlumierMD Acne Balancing Serum
3.) AlumierMD HydraClarit√© Moisturizer

Is there any other things I could add to help with my breakouts and that could reduce scarring and improve my skin texture?

1711586168.0,Can anyone help me with these? ,"Hii! I'm F(24), skintype : combination. I've been doing skincare for a while but kinda fell off a few months back and now I'm getting into it again. For the past two months I've just been trying to repair my skin barrier and get rid of hyperpigmentation on my forehead and uneven skintone on my face. My current skincare routine is as follows: 


**Morning:**

1. **Cleanse** (sometimes I skip this step if I feel it to be extra stripping) - Simple facewash/ Cerave foaming cleanser 

2. **Sunscreen** - Neutrogena sheer zinc (I skip moisturizer as it feels too heavy ony oily/combo skin)


**Night:**

1. **Cleanser** - Same cleanser (I don't use makeup so don't double cleanse)

2. **Exfoliate** - [be_minimalist aha bha exfoliator](https://beminimalist.co/products/aha-bha-10) (Twice a week)

3. **Serums** (for pigmentation) - [Alpha arbutin 2%](https://beminimalist.co/products/alpha-arbutin-2) and [tranxemic acid 3%](https://beminimalist.co/products/tranexamic-3-hpa) - I sometimes layer them or apply only one and alternate on days as TA one has mandelic acid in it so I don't apply that always for fear of over exfoliation

4. **Moisturizer** - Cerave moisturizing lotion. I sometimes apply snail mucin all in one cream over it for extra moisturizing (on the days I exfoliate)

5. **Basting** - This is not exactly a daily step but once a week I'd just cleanse, moisturize and apply zinc oxide ([Cetaphil](https://www.cetaphil.in/baby-skincare/cetaphil-baby-diaper-cream/IN_7613036454308.html) one) over my face to help with any inflammation. This idea is from Dr Shereen idriss' YouTube channel. I tried it and it helps my skin. The next day my face is supple and moisturised. 


I've kept it reasonably simple but I've been struggling with a few skincare concerns lately and I can't get rid of them. I've put [PICTURES HERE](https://imgur.com/a/KZPNnAn). 


1. The main concern is those spiky whitehead kinda things on my nose and on my chin below my lips. No matter what I do they don't go away. I've tried salicylic acid in the past (leave in and facewash, separate times) and the exfoliator I'm using now has glycolic+lactic acid in it but still it doesn't do much. And in the corner of my nose there seems to be blackheads? So I'm confused, are those blackheads or whiteheads? Idk what those are. Any suggestions to get rid of them?

&nbsp;

2. Texture on my face. It has improved a lot recently but still. Any way to improve more on that?

&nbsp;

3. Uneven skintone. There's a bit of pigmentation around mouth and forehead. Redness too, here and there. I'm using alpha arbutin and that has been working. The spots on my cheeks have faded a great deal. Think I'll continue with it? I was thinking of adding [Kojic acid](https://www.apollopharmacy.in/otc/kojic-skin-cream-25gm?utm_source=google&utm_medium=srnb&campaignid=17280487350&adgroupid=&keyword=&device=m&adtype=pla&product_id=KOJ0003&utm_campaign=Pmax_Pharma_ROI&utm_content=%5Badgroup%5D&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwh4-wBhB3EiwAeJsppPPrsu677UFbcBeusVtQHBAHVGUo1IV_6TY0Y17IufqlfZ8sOb0VAhoCbjMQAvD_BwE) slowly but would that be too much? 

&nbsp;

There's pigmentation in the lips but it has always been that way so I don't suppose I can do much in that regard. 

&nbsp;

ALSO I have these moles? on my face. They're visible on my cheeks like black dots. And have a few just below my eyes. They don't cause any problems and have been there since my childhood. I wanted to ask if it's safe to apply actives on them? (not the ones below my eye as I don't apply any actives near the eye area) I've been applying products on my face for quite sometime now and nothing has happened but still I wanted to ask. Will applying retinol etc be ok? 

&nbsp;

That seems to be the end of it. Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help the above given points. Thank you.

1711574664.0,This may be controversial.. retinol / clearer skin making you look older?,"For a while I have been seeing people around me using retinol, √°nd I have also heard about the tiktok- insta-hype of Gen Z-ers saying they look older than millenials.

For that last one, I have seen a lot of 'explanations' in reactionvideo's or from influencers, blaming the older look on the Gen Z-clothing style, to the use of botox, to vaping ect.

Personally I have wondered sometimes if it also might have to do with their skin looking 'too good'.. Some of the women at my work for example have flawless skin using retinol in their routine, and so do many Gen Z-ers.

However, flawless in the sense of the lack of redness, acne, very visable pores, ect.

This may sound weird, but having some oil shining on your face, some spots here and there, some enlarged pores around your nose... also makes you look..youthful?

Atleast for me, I feel like your brain automatically connects that with youth / teenager / a young skin that still creates a lot of own moisture. While women in their 40's / 50's often have a dryer skin.

Why?,"I don't know what caused it, if it was the new facial cleanser I got or if I perhaps let the new dandruff shampoo I got flow through my face, but I know when I got out of bathroom and looked at the mirror, it was like I was looking at a different person lmao

I took months to clear my acne and soften my skin and I was finally beginning to be satisfied with it, then boom, got these little bumps all over my face, but especially on my forehead and everything looked slightly red and dry. I hate the look now

I don't know if the cleanser was too rough or if it was the shampoo, like I said, but how to proceed? Is this a damaged skin barrier? And if so, can a single product really damage your barrier so significantly that quickly?

During the night, I still used the mandelic acid product I go for ocasionally that got rid of my acne  (I know in this situation, one would generally want to avoid acids, but I just refused to let it go as last night was night of using it lol) and today my face looks a lot better, but I don't know if I should just avoid the facial cleanser and AHAs and BHAs entirely and be gentle with my face or how to proceed so this ends as soon as possible and can I get back to improving my skin",Skincare_Addiction

My skin is quite oily and sensitive. I used the cerave foaming cleanser each morning because it says it's for oily skin. Turns out it makes my face break out later in the day and get quity oily and red.

I used a moisturizer aswell (neutrogena soothing clear) afterwards but I don't think that's working either and I'm considering switching to a different product.

Now I accepted my skin is maybe not soothed for too much skincare. So i just wash my face with the cerave hydrating cleanser AT NIGHT, no moisturizerin. In the morning i just shower and was my face with water. I did notice it getting less irritated at oily now. But I would still like to incorporate some form of moisturizer. maybe instead of the heavy creamy based neutrogena one I used some less invasive sort of moisturizer..?

PM:
- jojoba oil for cleansing 
- Dermasence cleansing Mousse (it‚Äòs with glycolic and salicylic acid) 
- cerave moisturizer 

i had zero skintexture 3 weeks ago but somehow it worsened
 when i tried the niacinamide from the inkey list and the hyalusome from dermascence (glycolic acid and vit C) to get it of it, it got only worse, i think it dehydrated my skin to much so :/ 
to repair my skin i made the tiktok flaxseed gel did a mask for 30 min twice a day for 3 days and it really improved a lot so now it‚Äòs looking okey again (as seen in pictures before the white heads were way more and my skin was looking very unhappy) 

i was thinking of incorporating a retinol? what‚Äòs your opinion?

also please leave me recomendations/ routines with korean products especially sunscreen (that does not itch in the eyes), an oil cleanser and maybe a cleanser in the morning (?), a serum or toner (?), moisturizer and any other tips <3

would really appreciate your help!<3",Skincare_Addiction

1711417129.0,"Just started getting into skin care, just would like some advice on my current routine, and any suggestions.","For some background info, I'm an 18 year old mixed (African-American/Caucasian) male. I've never done any serious research on skin care, just some casual Google searches and YouTube scrolling. Nor have I had any form of uniform skin care regiment, besides simply washing my face in the morning and night, either when I'm in the shower, or simply using a wetted wash cloth.

I use five main products right now, and I'm about to introduce a sixth that I just picked up at the store today.

Here are the products: 
‚ÄîEucerin Eczema relief cream (For hands and forearm, day and night use.)
‚ÄîHarry's Exfoliating Face Wash With Peppermint (To cleanse and exfoliate my face, morning and night use.)
‚ÄîBath & Body works Daily Face Lotion with Hyaluronic acid (For face moisturizer, day and night use.)
‚ÄîVaseline Petroleum Jelly (For lips and Eyebrows at night.)
‚ÄîHarmony Goat Farm Mango Madness Lip Balm (For my lips, day and night.)
‚ÄîNeutrogena Ultra Sheer dry-touch sun screen SPF 70 (I'm gonna introduce this for use during the morning and evening, on my face, neck, hands/arms, and legs when I'm wearing shorts.)


I've started a new skin care regiment as of recent. I could use some advice on the nuances of it.

In the morning and night, I have practically the exact same routine, with an extra step, or two, at night.

I start by lightly washing my face with water, before taking a clean paper towel or wash cloth, wetting it, and gently running it over my skin to get rid of any current product. Then, I'll wet it again, before using my Harry's exfoliating face wash, and squeezing a pea size amount onto my hand. I'll then lightly dab that with my finger, and evenly place dots on my face, before wetting my hands and gently rubbing it into my skin. After a few minutes, which I usually spend washing my teeth, I rinse it off with water, and repeat the previous step of lightly wiping any remaining residue off with a paper towel or wash cloth. 

Then, I wet my skin lightly once more, before using my Bath & Body works face lotion. I use the same technique of applying it as when I apply my face wash. I then apply the lip balm on my lips, then apply the Eucerin Eczema relief cream on my hands, and a little on my forearms. Then I'm on the go, ready to start my day. I plan to also take an extra step to apply my new sunscreen after the face lotion and eczema cream, putting it on my face, neck, hands/arms, and my legs when wearing shorts.

At night I'll also put on some Petroleum jelly (Vaseline) on my lips over the lip balm, to lock in moisture. I'll also apply a little on my eyebrows, because why not, maybe they'll become softer.


That's about it, all advice is appreciated, I am a novice. Though I heard it's bad to use a physical exfoliate (which I think the Harry's thing is because of the little gritty stuff) more than once a week...and I'm using one basically twice a day, but it says it's okay for daily use, and some reviews have said that it's gritty-ness is less than other face washes, so...I don't know, any suggestions on that front would be appreciated.

P.S.
I've just started this whole routine less than a week ago, and I haven't had any outbreaks or suspicious sensations so far. I've been using the Eucerin on my hands intermittently for years, basically whenever my hands dry up. I used the Harry's for a little while a year or two back, but not as frequently as I am now. The lip balm is also somewhat new, and I haven't used any in months. Everything else is brand new, so the moisturizer, vaseline, and sunscreen.

For most of my life I've had a smooth forehead barring acne issues which I don't care that much about but back in January I got pretty sick and ever since I've had these damn lines. They're probably just expression lines but I literally never actually noticed them until January and now they won't go away. They're seriously pissing me off and I hate them so much.

I don't really have a skincare routine and yeah I probably should've wore sunscreen more. Also I def don't drink enough water daily. Am I just f'd now? I'm so young and I don't wanna worry about this.

They can't be true wrinkles, they're super thin and I've put some cheap moisturizer in them and a section of the top literally disappeared but unfortunately came back after 10 minutes. I've been washing my face every night and putting in this moisturizer every day (albeit sometimes I forget some days, sometimes I've gone a week without it) and yet its still there. I guess I'm still not drinking enough.

I don't get how I was just as unhealthy and didn't have a skincare routine just two years ago but didn't have these lines but then I just wake up one day and now they're always there. So annoying :(

1711377793.0,Is SPF mist sufficient enough for sitting in front of a window?,"Hi all! 
So I absolutely know the importance of good SPF and always wear sunscreen when I leave the house. My favourite is La Roche-Posay 50+ invisible fluid. I always wear it when I'm going anywhere.

However I work from home and recently moved so now my new desk setup is in front of a big window. I have blinds but like to let some light in the room so I usually have them half down and the sun does often shine on my face. So I'm worried about sun exposure from sitting in front of the window for prolonged periods of time. But if I'm just at home all day and not leaving the house, I don't want to use my LRP sunscreen because it feels like a waste, you know?

So I bought a sunscreen mist (Sculpted by Aimee Sun Mist SPF 50+) which I thought might work as an alternative. I know that mists don't offer the same protection but since I'm not directly in the sun, I thought it could work for when I'm sitting there.

What do you think? Would they be good enough protection?",Skincare_Addiction

I M(17) recently started skin care back in August of 2023 as I had pretty good skin, no acne but I wanted a nicer brighter face. During the winter im pretty dry skined, but seasons are starting to change and I can notice my skin getting a little oiler? I found this out as during the winter Lotions are to light but now they seem to work fine. I would say I have combo skin leaning to the drier side, but for some reason Im hearing talk about mabey haveing a dehydrated forehead so I want to look into that.

Skin Type: Combo-Dry

Sensitive Forhead maby?

AM: Loracho Posay Hydrating Cleanser for Dry, Ice my face, Seoul Vit C Serum, round lab 1025 dokdomoisurizer, Corsx Sunscreen.

PM: Cera V Cream to foam cleanser, RoundLab 1025 Dokdo moisturizer

Once a week I exofilate with paulas choice( only done this twice)

Concerns: I just got this new moisturizer, and I cant tell if im using to much or its to heavy, becaus its leaving with this greasy kind of feeling. I just got this moisturizer which replaced the Cera V moisturizing lotion which didnt work in winter but might work in the hotter days, and before that I used Cera V Moisturizing Cream which was alright.

Should I be adding more products into my regiment like the round lab or not like toners, and snail mucin, im really new to Asian Beuty so I dont want to go in.

Problems/questions:

\-Bumby/ Acne forehead that I cant seem to fix

\-I cant tell if im using the right moisturiizer( not enough or to Much)

\-What my skin type is im very confused as what if its Dry or Combo or deydrated

\-Why I am getting forhead acne??? Its very random and why i dont every get acne their

\-Same thing with my cheeck acne

\-How long shoud I give a product before its fully working like my new moisturizer

So one issue that I have is keratosis pilaris. It‚Äôs on my arms and my face.

So I pulled some skincare products out tonight and decided to just go for it and STICK WITH IT. First I used my cerave moisturizing cleanser, then a face cream, and then a couple drops of oil and gently patted it in. 

I already feel like it‚Äôs a bit better, feels softer for sure. I still feel some flaking but I‚Äôm hoping that will get better as I go. Is there ANYTHING else (budget friendly lol.) that would help to include, or a different brand of cleanser/face cream? I think the one I grabbed was ponds.

I'm writing this because I don't really know what to do on terms of sunscreen.

I feel like I tested many sunscreens and my skin seems to like none of them...
I tested skin 1004 hyaluronic acid sunscreen, and instree HA one and they had the same results, little bumps on my face, clogged pores I think... After that I realized that my skin didn't like HA (I tested a serum with HA and my skin didn't react well)...

But the thing is that HA isn't the only ingredient that my skin doesn't like....my skin isn't okay with niacinamide as well (I tried several products with niacinamide and my skin didn't like it at all)
I feel trapped cause there's practically niacinamide and HA everywhere üò≠ I can never be set free.

A while ago I bought THANK YOU FARMER sunscreen, the light sun essence and the water normal one...I thought that because there isn't any ha or niacinamide (at least in the sun essence they weren't any), my skin would be okay ...but no...I had pimples and my skin texture got worse...there's many oil in the composition and Yuka rated the sunscreens badly  (both rated 0/100 üò¨)

I also apply makeup after so maybe it contributes to clogging pores ?

Sunscreen's really important so I really would want a good one to stick with...do y'all have any recommendations (*without* **hyaluronic** **acid**, **niacinamide** and a bad ingredients list)(btw I have *acne*, *oily* on the T zone and *pore-clogging* skin)( ik that's hard to find but my skin is just sensitive üò≠) ?

This was the time I got into skincare and I started using retinols, azelaic acid, etc2. A year later, my skin had gotten significantly better. I kinda feel like skin gets better on its own overtime and its not something we can expect to see results overnight. Also recently, I‚Äôve started using TO peel weekly and this has also helped a lot. But the basics never go wrong, a good moisturiser and a good sunscreen goes a long wayyy.

1710964346.0,No skincare is better than full skincare routine ,"Hi! I used to have horrible skincare routine that only consisted of water and moisturizer. I decided to change my routine in order to combat hormonal acne and blackheads. My acne was not severe at all to begin with, I would only get a zit or two a week before period and that's all. But I was adament to get a perfect glass skin. 

I went to a skin therapist that helped me build a skincare routine. At night I would:
Clean with Av√®ne- clearence gel together with the ordinary squalane for double cleansing. Then I would end it with bioderma sebium hydra moisturizer. 

On morning I would only use water, and use the moisturizer again and then use vichy- capital soleil 50 spf. 

I tried this for a month and my skin is horrible. As soon as I use products on my skin I get closed comedones, especially on my forehead. My skin used to never react this way. Some were really inflamed so I decided to stop using anything other than water and moisturizer and now they are all gone.

1710959255.0,finally mastered my skincare routine !!,"pic order - skincare routine products , sides of face before morning wash and a month into routine , mid day pic after work after a month into routine 

after struggling with cystic hormonal acne since freshman year of high school (and it was BAD to the point smiling or furrowing my brows would irritate the crusty pustules and i‚Äôd ooze pus) it died down on its own in the later years and during covid i really tried to get on top of my skincare . it was hard . having adhd and autism , self care doesn‚Äôt come easy so it was a heavy on n off battle from seeing an aesthetician and using harsh products .

finally , this year , just a month back , i‚Äôve setup this perfect routine for myself and it‚Äôs helped IMMENSELY . my scarring and hyperpigmentation is going away , active acne is under control , and best of all , my skin never feels oily or dry after this due to how i curated this exactly to my skin . 

BPO works great for me but can be annoyingly drying esp since i need a higher dosage , so i opted out of a cream/serum in place for the 10% BPO face wash . Salicylic also works great for me but again , hella drying , and dry skin for me leads to excess of oil . so it‚Äôs a toner with more glycolic than salicylic for a focus on texture , enough to exfoliate anything the wash missed while not necessarily being a leave on product to continue drying when i don‚Äôt need it . 

now snail mucin , it‚Äôs an odd one for me rn but it helps w my skins elasticity and creating a moisture barrier for the products i add on next since they‚Äôve proven to be slightly irritating without it . 10% niacinamide serum for texture , so far this is the only serum i‚Äôve found where it‚Äôs not mixed w BHA‚Äôs or AHA‚Äôs and is almost solely one thing . 

after that is my more active stuff . to replace a BPO cream i‚Äôve opted into 0.1% adapolene and after an adjustment period i now use it morning and night . i pair that w 10% azelaic acid to combat more of that texture and pigmentation .

finally we‚Äôre nearing the end !! lock all those products in with a moisturizer that isn‚Äôt technically a moisturizer . cerave hyaluronic acid serum . cerave is great at making any product feel moisturizing but marketed moisturizers actually do too much for my face and don‚Äôt leave with the matte finish i enjoy . this helps my skin barrier after the medicated products without it being heavy . 

sunscreen ! i mix a few drops of vitamin c serum with my amazing sunscreen and boom i‚Äôm done ! this sunscreen is amazing if u struggle to find one that isn‚Äôt heavy and doesn‚Äôt leave ur face feeling oily , throughout the day it stays matte too . little to no white cast AND a new formula that makes it much easier to spread on the skin .",Skincare_Addiction

Initially I didn't have any breakouts or issues except some flaking and dryness around the mouth, but l've since learned that it's not a good idea to put tret there! I was using a sulphur soap bar every night but I have switched this to only on non-tret nights as it can be quite harsh. The issue I'm having is that it's making me extremely oily, I constantly look like I'm wearing layer of vaseline! I have done research and understand that it's normal to purge but I haven't seen any discussions about oiliness, and also not sure if the purge is meant to last this long. I know oiliness is a symptom of dehydration of the skin. I moisturise in the morning and evening, and slug maybe twice a week, as needed.
I've not been using the sulphur at all over the last week or so as was worried it was contributing to the dehydration, and opted for a gentle hydrating cleanser instead but this has made no difference to the oiliness, and lead to me actually waking up with about ten new spots each day, which is why l've restarted sulphur on non-tret nights.

1710942373.0,Skincare Routine Advice and Dealing with Folliculitis After Shaving and in general (male),"Post:

Hello everyone,

I hope you‚Äôre all doing well. I‚Äôve been adjusting my skincare routine over the past few months but unfortunately, I‚Äôm running into some issues, specifically with folliculitis after shaving. I wanted to share my current routine and the problem, hoping to get some advice or recommendations from the community.

Morning Routine:

	‚Ä¢	Shower (no specific skincare products in the morning)

Evening Routine:

	1.	Cleansing: I start with Balea Sensitive Wash Gel to clean my face.
	2.	Shaving:
	‚Ä¢	I use the One Blade razor. Before shaving, I wash my face with warm water and apply the Balea wash gel.
	‚Ä¢	Then, I use Nivea shaving foam (the white ‚ÄúIce‚Äù version), let it sit for about 2 minutes, and use the shaving attachment as shown in the photo.
	‚Ä¢	After shaving, I rinse my face with cold water.
	3.	Aftercare:
	‚Ä¢	I apply zinc cream to some spots and use Avene Cicalfate to soothe the skin.

Problem: Despite this routine, I regularly develop folliculitis after shaving. I didn‚Äôt have issues with redness before using the One Blade razor, so I suspect it might be due to a dirty blade.

Has anyone had similar experiences or can offer tips on how to treat or avoid folliculitis? Are there any products or methods you can recommend to soothe the skin after shaving and prevent the formation of folliculitis?

I‚Äôm very grateful for any advice and recommendations!",Skincare_Addiction
1710931438.0,My Top 3 Cleansing Balms,"1. Farmacy Green Clean - Hands *down* the best cleaning balm as far as removing 100% of makeup/SPF/daily impurities, ease of use, overall experience it provides, quality, & results. The classic sorbet texture is really elevated, imo. It has a lovely, light citrus scent, & emulsifies incredibly easily with zero residue left behind. It‚Äôs also noncomedogenic (I‚Äôm SO happy it doesn‚Äôt contain Coconut Oil), & non-sensitizing (WHY do brands put things like menthol/eucalyptus in products that you are obviously going to be using on your eye-area????). If you‚Äôre looking for an everyday ‚Äúget it done, but I still want to enjoy it‚Äù first cleanse, this is it. It really is such a fantastic + effective cleansing balm for all skin types!
*if this is out of your price range, the Elf Holy Hydration! Cleansing Balm makes an excellent, affordable dupe
**edit - Green Clean also comes in an Essential Oil/fragrance-free option called Clearly Clean, perfect for those who have sensitive skin/prefer to go without these ingredients; they have the exact same formula, with the same texture + results


2. Elemis Superfood Glow Cleansing Butter (previously called their Superfood AHA Glow Cleansing Butter //not reformulated//) - The most *luxurious* cleansing balm on the planet. It‚Äôs everything I wanted their ever-popular Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm to be, & more. The consistency is the epitome of decadent‚Äîbuttery, & smooth‚Äîyet not overly heavy/greasy (like their Pro-Collagen is). It feels exactly like massaging softened butter on your face in the absolute best possible way. It emulsifies incredibly easily‚Äîleaving your skin feeling soft, supple, nourished, & clean. I LOVE the fact that it brightens the complexion without any added irritants, while also being noncomedogenic (unlike their Pro-Collagen, which contains both Coconut Oil, & ~475+ Essential Oils). While this cleansing balm does effectively remove all of my makeup (including eye makeup), I find it to be *way* too special to simply be used as a daily first-step makeup remover‚Äîthough it can be used this way. I personally prefer to use it as something of a ‚Äútreatment‚Äù/wash-off mask. I‚Äôll take my sweet time working it into my skin, & then leave it on for 3-10+ minutes. I‚Äôm always blown away by the results! I *highly* recommend giving this cleansing balm a try if you‚Äôre looking for a real skincare treat for your ‚Äúme time‚Äù.
*it‚Äôs easy to find this at a much more affordable price on sites like Mercari; Ipsy also often has it available in their shop at a deep discount


3. The Inkey List Oat Cleansing Balm - This is definitely the best affordable cleansing balm I‚Äôve come across (though I‚Äôd pay way more for it if it had a high-end price tag). I put off trying it for SO long due to the mixed reviews. Well I can say with absolute certainty that I only agree with the positive ones. It‚Äôs become my N¬∞1 favorite ‚Äúin-shower‚Äù oil-based cleanser. I find it does an amazing job of preventing TEWL (Transepidermal Water Loss) for my face from the hot shower steam. I also loveeee the fact that the deliciously thick + nourishing formula never causes my dehydrated, combination-oily skin to breakout, while also rinsing easily + 100% clean (this is an issue I saw mentioned in some reviews, never once have I had this problem). It also removes my makeup SO WELL. Right on par with Green Clean! Something to note is that it does contain some gentle physical exfoliants. I believe it‚Äôs from the added oat kernel. I personally love the extra benefits it provides. The combination of the richer ingredients with the physical exfoliation makes for a really beautiful product‚Äîone that leaves my skin oh so soft + smooth, yet still lightly enveloped in nourishment. The squeeze tube format is also super convenient (I also appreciate the fact that I can give the tube a good shake before use, so I know all of the ingredients are properly incorporated with each other‚Äîthis is another negative I came across in the reviews, & this easily solves the issue for me). A 5oz tube lasts for legitimately ages, making this my go-to for every shower. I find it so much easier to use in the shower than a traditional tub balm, so I never have to remove my makeup/wash my face separately in the sink beforehand (just be sure you adjust your water temp to mild/tepid before use). There really isn‚Äôt a downside to trying this cleansing balm. I‚Äôm over the moon I finally did, since I‚Äôm hooked for life. I often reach for it over my other 25+ oil-based cleansers. I definitely recommend giving it a try, especially if you‚Äôre the type to quickly blow through cleansing balms.
*I always double-cleanse with a water-based cleanser after using any oil-based cleanser



A few notes on some of the cleansing balms I *don‚Äôt* recommend -


Sephora Melting Cleansing Balm - This might be the worst cleansing balm I‚Äôve ever tried in my life. Like I actually want to have an in-person conversation with any one of the people that posted a 5 star review on the Sephora app (there isn‚Äôt a ton, but there‚Äôs enough to make me question everything I know, & believe in). I‚Äôm the type to always gravitate towards unique textures in skincare. I LOVE trying them out‚Äîmore lush + special the better. So when I saw the way this cleansing balm was described, & shown, I knew I had to try it. Oh man. It‚Äôs awful. Awful. While I know there is a time, & a place for non-emulsifying oil-based cleansers, this just takes it way too far. I‚Äôm left with what feels exactly like a surprisingly thick layer of greasy gunk all over my face, despite opting for the addition of a makeup cloth to remove it (my go-to will always be The Original Makeup Eraser, such a freaking game changer). It almost feels like I could still scrape it off with my finger nail after rinsing. On top of this, it doesn‚Äôt take off so much as a scrap of makeup. What the heck is in this stuff? You know how I mentioned The Inkey List‚Äòs cleaning balm doesn‚Äôt feel too heavy, yet leaves my skin nourished? Well instead of that, this stuff has the exact same consistency as Vaseline. Now imagine trying to use that to remove your makeup. Then trying to scrub it off your delicate face. Re-freaking-diculous. This cleansing balm is only $12, so if you‚Äôre feeling incredibly brave/adventurous, you can easily give it a go. However, I hardcore recommend against it. The Inkey List‚Äôs is even less $ for way more! But hey, skincare is personal. You do you.


Clinique Take The Day Off Cleansing Balm - Unlike the Sephora cleansing balm, this one isn‚Äôt straight up trash. It just doesn‚Äôt deserve the hype it readily gets, imo. It‚Äôs the exact opposite of how I describe the elevated sorbet texture of Farmacy‚Äôs Green Clean. I find Clinique‚Äôs to be incredibly plain, boring, & honestly not the best for makeup removal. I expected this to be Top Tier when it comes to removing even the toughest/most stubborn makeup. So I was super disappointed when I struggled to remove so much as my non-waterproof mascara. I do see why it *used* to be known as the best‚Äîsince it‚Äôs overall straight to the point + fragrance-free, & does eventually take off makeup with a little extra elbow grease. However, these days there are SO many better options out there. I just don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs still so dang hyped-up/popular. 



I hope this helps! Feel free to ask any questions on cleansing balms, or oil-based cleansers in general. I‚Äôve tried practically every single one I‚Äôve been able to get my hands on. And all the others I still have opinions on. 99% of them are on my wishlist, I‚Äôll without a doubt get there eventuallyü´†",Skincare_Addiction

Mostly I've always had pretty dry skin and eczema, which means I have generally gotten away with not having an actual routine for pimples other than a foaming cleanser some nights (when I remember üò≠), but recently my skin has started acting up. It's nothing dramatic, but I've noticed that the pores on my cheeks/nose have gotten bigger, and I usually have small bumps/blackhead-type zits on my forehead and chin that just keep popping up. That and the blind pimples. Man, I HATE those. They're huge and always leave a red welt/mark for WEEKS, and it's driving me crazy. 

I want to have a skincare routine because I'm pretty sure my current breakouts are basically down to me being...well....lazy and  also with extra stress in recent months it just exacerbates that and I think it would definitely help. I use a gentle facial scrub with Niacinamide like 2 times a week, but I'm convinced I might as well not bother if I don't have other skincare steps. 

Does anybody have tips on where to start? Something not too long or complicated given I have ADHD and I forget easily, and dry-skin friendly? 

I know it's a lot to ask, but I really want to make the change and give myself a routine, because right now it's affecting my self-esteem but at the same time I just don't know where to start.

When I wake up, my lips are dry but not like cracking or any dead skin. I‚Äôll go through my skincare and makeup as normal and at the end of my routine I put on either vaseline or aquaphor. It feels fine for like an hour but then I feel this weird film that is always on the like inside-ish of my lips. I take it off and reapply but it will happen every couple of hours. 

They don‚Äôt feel dry at all but this happens consistently. I got my lips pierced a couple weeks ago and it hasn‚Äôt made the issue any better or worse so I know that isn‚Äôt a reason.

(before/after photos),"Hey all, I‚Äôve worked for 10+ years trying to clear my acne (and have been extremely successful at times), but if there is ONE thing in the ENTIRE world that I wish someone had explained to me sooner, is that skincare will NOT fix hormonal acne!

I‚Äôve been seeing so many women lately with acne that is VERY clearly hormonal and they are sooo frustrated (understandably), but they‚Äôre also frustrated that new skincare isn‚Äôt working or they think that a previous product in their routine was responsible for breaking them out. This is not what‚Äôs happening! Hormonal acne is internal and it will never ever ever get fixed with skincare alone. (Not even Tretinoin)

The pictures were taken 4 months apart, and I did not ever change ONE single thing about my skincare routine. I cleared it up by treating the issue internally. I took supplements to help balance my hormones (just regular vitamins and teas). I didn‚Äôt even have to cut out dairy or any of those typical things people recommend. My hormones had just gotten a little out of whack and I was producing too many androgens.

Update on update post lol: Mods locked the update post for....some reason so ig I'll just post what I said here:

Hey everyone,

So my post got a lot more attention than I expected lol

I'm very thankful for the all the responses but, If I'm completely honest, I'm quite a bit overwhelmed with all the suggestions. There's a lot of people asking me to try a lot of different things and I simply do not have the time or money to try everything :(

To answer a few of the common suggestions:

1.Isotretinoin/spironolactone:  Unfortunately, I am not able to go on isotretinoin/accutane at the present time. I am moving around too much to get the required monthly testing done. I also am currently dealing with more prioritized health issues (both mental and physical) and I believe that the effects of isotretinoin would exacerbate the negative effects of these issues and interrupt their treatment.

I actually had a previous derm recommend spiro but he told me that I would need to be constantly monitored for low blood pressure and 1. that is very scary and 2. it goes back to my first point.

(I'm ngl the people talking about possible nerve damage + heart palpitations from spiro also scares me, the known side effects of isotret also really scare me, hence me not doing either to this day)

2.Spearmint/Mint/Green tea: I actually haven't had spearmint tea before. It sounds like a great option but, unfortunately, it has tannins which would limit the absorption of my current required supplements. 

I have regularly drank matcha in the past, I don't think it really had an impact on my acne, though.

3.Seeking medical help/dermatologist: I have seen 4 dermatologists in the past. One gave me a bunch of topicals and niacin, no big changes. Another put me on Epiduo, no big changes. The last put me on an antibiotic I no longer remember and that was probably the clearest skin I've ever had. Unfortunately, I couldn't be on it long term and it all came back as soon as I went off it :')

That last one was the one who recommended spiro. 

I haven't gone back to a dermatologist cause I can't really afford it anymore and I just got tired of not getting results. I wasn't ready for spiro or isotret so I just stopped.

4.Blood work for hormone checking/allergies: I have never had blood work done for hormones, I'm not really sure what that means. I'm not really sure how I would go about that and what that'd mean for my skin.

I have had blood work done for allergens, no identified major allergies except moderate dust allergy. 

5.Stress: Unfortunately, I think my life is just gonna be pretty stressful for a while lol. I don't come from a wealthy family and I have a pretty useless degree (+ a plethora of other problems) so my life is just kinda composed of stress atm. 

6.Diet: Oh boy. So, I feel I do my best to eat as healthy as I can. I make an effort to eat vegetables every day and fruit when I can. I drink pretty much only water. I make sure I stay at or under the recommended daily values for sodium and added sugar. I avoid dairy and meat as much as I can. I've made an effort to increase my olive oil/avocado intake. 

A lot of people are saying to cut sugar entirely. I'm sorry but I simply can't do that. Idk if you saw it in my post but I avoid A LOT of things: alcohol, drugs, meat, dairy. Sugar is the one thing I have left that makes eating enjoyable. I do make an effort to not go above 25 mg of added sugar a day. I just can't give it up entirely, I really don't have much to look forward to each day with how my life is going rn and it's my one little guilty pleasure I can have to brighten the day up a bit.

7.Zinc: I HAVE done a zinc soap before, I don't think it really made much of a difference. Maybe I should look into a zinc supplement, I would need to check interactions with my current supplements, though. 

8.Fibroids: I've had x-rays done in my pelvic area and have never heard anything about these. Maybe they're only detectable w other imaging? I don't think I could afford a CAT or MRI scan rn :(

9.Birth Control: I have thought many, MANY times about going on birth control. My family has a really bad history with birth control, specifically the pill. I've thought about an IUD but haven't heard anything about it clearing acne. Idk I've just heard so many traumatic things about birth control from the people around me and I've just been really hesitant to get on it (don't worry, I've never been sexually active). I also heard your acne just comes back  x10 once you get off.

10.Hair products: I literally don't use anything in my hair lmao, I use hairspray VERY rarely. I do have oily ass hair that may cause some of my forehead acne but I cannot control that unless I just go bald.

11.Pregnancy: I know this isn't really a suggestion but I also don't really plan on having kids for a multitude of reasons soooo I don't even have that to look forward to üò≠

12.Fungal: I'm pretty sure I was told my acne was not fungal at some point by a derm. I def believe it is hormonal, idk I could be wrong, maybe fungal acne can be hormonal?


There's quite a few people who asked for my skin type/products so here ya go:

My skin type: OILYYY and SENSITIVEEEE holy shit I don't know anyone with more sensitive skin than me 

My products:
I only rinse with water and then moisturize  (Cerave Moisturizing Cream (yes, I know this is a controversial one!! unfortunately, I HAVE to buy it anyways for my eczema (nothing else works) and I don't really have the budget to be buying two moisturizers rn) + spf (physical zinc sunscreen) in the morning. 

Evening:
Salicylic Acid Cleanser (I leave it on for like 5 min before rinsing)

1694105731.0,I went two weeks without deodorant & this is what happened:,"Edit: So weird how you can explain how something is working for you and people will *still* be recommending products üòÖ. I appreciate it everyone, I know you‚Äôre just trying to help but I‚Äôm good right now lmao. I‚Äôve tried 99% of the products y‚Äôall are suggesting anyways. 

The only thing I did was wash in the shower, and apply The ordinary‚Äôs glycolic acid toner to my armpits about twice a day. Either with my hands or a cotton pad. 

The pros: 

Didn‚Äôt smell at all, had multiple people check for me. Smelled like absolutely nothing

My pits didn‚Äôt feel goopy or slimy or sticky or crusty. I find that deodorant always clumps up on me and gets gross, especially if I have a bit of hair. 

No aluminum! 

No ingrown hairs and I got a cleaner shave because there was less dead skin 

I felt extremely clean 

My armpits weren‚Äôt as itchy, which is why I did this experiment in the first place, I felt like I was always having a reaction to the chemicals in normal deodorants and antiperspirants. 

Super cheap! 

I felt like I sweat less 

The cons:

Didn‚Äôt have that extra boost of nice floral smell whenever i‚Äôd move my arms

That‚Äôs it 

Will I go back to wearing deodorant? If I can find like a gel based one that that dries down and doesn‚Äôt have aluminum, maybe, just for the nice smell, but overall I don‚Äôt think I will be purchasing traditional deodorant or antiperspirant ever again. I want like a natural armpit perfume or something. Something in deodorants/antiperspirants make my armpits super itchy and bumpy so this is a great revelation for me. plus I just don‚Äôt love wearing them 

Why does this work? The stuff that actually makes us smell isn‚Äôt our sweat. if that was the case, our whole body would stink all the time. The thing that actually makes us smell is the bacteria that interacts with the sweat. The bacteria thrives in warm, moist environments which is why the things that usually stink are genitals, armpits, and feet. These stinky bacteria can only thrive if the skin‚Äôs pH is 5.5-6.5. Glycolic acid‚Äôs pH is anywhere from 0.08-2.75 which is much more acidic than our armpit‚Äôs natural climate. Therefore, the bacteria can‚Äôt survive, and the stink cannot thrive.",Skincare_Addiction

I'm from the south of Spain. My family is a family of fishermen. Basically I was raised on the beach and on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, so giving up sunbathing sounds impossible to me.

I'm fully aware of how damaging it is, so I try to do all the possible things to avoid that damage. I wear my SPF religiously, I know what time of the day is the worst/best to lay under the sun, I know tips and tricks to treat the skin after a day on the beach, etc. But if you took away sunbathing from me, if you took away just sitting at a bar table under the sun and drinking something with my friends, if you took sun out of my life, I would literally feel so miserable.

1617880039.0,Y'all were not lying about sunscreen.,"I saw a bunch of posts about sunscreen, but I always thought there is NO WAY it has any effect on my skin. 

I'm not even out in the sun that much?!  And they are sticky, and smell like awkward puberty summers?!

*Boy, I was wrong.*

After the 50th r/Skincare_Addiction post about sunscreens I decided to buy one. I especially went for ""light texture"" because you know... sticky. And I was searching for face creams, not the type you put on your body, face and dog if you want.

I've been using Apivita ""Oil balance"" Sunscreen for 2 months now, almost every day, and my skin never looked better. I usually had 2-3 pimples on my chin and cheeks, all the time. But now they are gone. 

So if you were looking for a sign to try sunscreen and put it into your routine, **THIS IS IT!**",Skincare_Addiction

1704305875.0,I'm in shock... go read Skintelligent.,"So I just finished reading Skintelligent by Dr. Natalia Spierings and I think it might have just changed my life. This is going to be a long post. Cross-posted.

Tl;Dr: The book, Skintelligent, radically changed the way I see skincare. Most ""active"" ingredients are marketing scams, and you only need to cleanse once a day with a very gentle, oil-based cleanser no matter your skin type, use targeted, mostly prescription treatments for skin concerns, and use Vaseline at night, and only if you feel dry. Fancy stuff is fine and won't hurt you, but is a waste of money. However, I acknowledge that product preference is a very personal experience and that oil-based products are not for everyone.

I've read two other books on skincare in the past several months as well as done a lot of research on the Internet as I have recently become concerned with some minor signs of aging in my skin.¬†

The only issue I've had with acne since my early twenties was about 5 years ago when I got an IUD and developed severe cystic hormonal acne. I started spironolactone and have barely seen a few spots since then. I went through a period of depression after that and stopped doing anything to my skin, not even washing it unless I took a shower and that definitely didn't happen every day. Curiously, I still didn't have breakouts. I think I've been pretty lucky in the genetic lottery (only in the realm of skin, my overall health is not great).

But in the last few months, I've been doing better with my mood and wanted to get serious about skincare again. I'm 37 and started noticing fine lines (my mom thinks I'm crazy lol). So I found a moisturizer that was from a reputable company that was ""better"" than the drugstore brands but wouldn't break my bank and bought that, a cleanser, a retinol serum, and sunscreen. I am pretty happy with them but haven't noticed any differences, so I started following this sub and skincare addicts and doing more research and decided that maybe I would ""upgrade"" when I was done with my current products and add a few more actives for anti-aging.

Then someone recommended Skintelligent. The first book I read was written by a skincare journalist, so I wasn't totally sold on it, but I got it with my Kindle Unlimited subscription and figured it couldn't hurt. I was pretty impressed. The author had interviewed dermatologists and seemed to have read the scientific research. I was not surprised by any of her claims and it all made sense from what I remembered from my teen years, but with updated guidance. She described the parts of skin and how they work; skin typing; common issues, what cause them, and treatments and preventative measures; what ingredients to avoid; which actives actually work and how to tell effective products from those with problematic formulations; and what order in which to use the various types of products. I felt better informed, but mostly validated in what I already knew. The second book was more of the same, but perhaps a little less specific. Also, it was written by a dermatologist and she added some information on in-office procedures and more invasive treatments. Again, more validation. Skintelligent, however, was very different.

Dr. Spierings is a consultant dermatologist in the UK and the book was published in 2022. She went much more in depth with her description of skin and with pretty much everything else she explained with actual scientific research backing it up. She explained the issues with most ""scientific"" studies and the ramifications those issues have on their claims. She provided information that indicates the marketing claims of every - and I mean every - active ingredient that hasn't been approved by the FDA (in the US), the MHRA (the UK), and the EMA (the EU) are over-inflated and under-fulfilled.¬†

Over the counter retinoids? She ""critically appraised the randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled (meaning the effects of the 'vehicle' or cream that included the topical retinoid was compared to the effects of the cream without the retinoid) trials of the use of over the counter vitamin A products in the treatment of facial skin aging. Four of the trials showed no statistically significant differences between the vitamin A derivative product and vehicle. The remaining five trials provided weak evidence... of a mild positive effect on fine facial skin wrinkles only. However, these trials all had major issues with how they were performed which calls into question the validity of any positive results.""¬†

Vitamin C? ""The negative effects of UV light on skin happen in real time so the antioxidant must be present continuously in or on the skin at the correct concentration without being inactivated. So, if topical vitamins are meant to work as photo-protectants, they need to undergo the same type of vigorous real-life testing as sunscreens. More research is needed."" Also, ""vitamin C is a water-soluble and charged molecule and is repelled by the physical barrier of the cells of the epidermis... Topically applied vitamin C probably does not reach the dermis (the location of the collagen and elastin it supposedly works on) in any significant concentration."" And finally, ""if you have plenty of vitamin C in your blood, topical application does not increase skin vitamin C content.""

Hyaluronic acid? ""There is only one clinical study examining the penetration of HA creams in the epidermis. Though... unblinded and uncontrolled with a very small sample size, it showed both high and low molecular weight HA in a cream base did not penetrate the stratum corneum (the outer layer of skin).¬†

Niacinamide? ""Any study not sponsored by industry shows equivocal or negative findings.""

On the other hand, topical treatments that are prescribed by a doctor are safe and effective. This includes tretinoin, adapalene, and tazarotene (all versions of retinoic acid or vitamin A derivatives prescribed for acne, psoriasis, and anti-aging),¬† hydroquinone (the ""gold-standard"" treatment for hyperpigmentation), and azelaic acid (best used for treating skin conditions in pregnancy, there are better, more effective treatments for acne, rosacea, and hyperpigmentation). Glycolic acid was noted to possibly enhance the appearance of skin without compromising its function when used regularly at low concentrations. The author mentioned that it ""probably enhanced the effectiveness"" of hydroquinone in the treatment of solar-induced pigmentation and melasma. Salicylic acid has comedone- (a type of acne) clearing as well as antibacterial properties. While tretinoin is more effective, salicylic acid can be used for mild acne. It is also useful to reduce scale in the treatment of dandruff. Benzoyl peroxide is ""the most powerful topical treatment for acne"" and can safely be used in combination with adapalene, salicylic acid, and antibiotics. Use of BP with tretinoin should be separated with the tretinoin at night and the BP in the morning, if it's necessary. Topical treatments for acne should be used on the entire face and not as a spot treatment, ""in fact, using topical acne medications on fully inflamed lesions potentially further irritates already irritated skin... and might be the reason why acne appears to 'get worse' at the beginning of treatment with a topical retinoid."" However, light therapy for acne or anti-aging is a ""marketing gimmick and won't help.""

For a skincare, she said simple is best. ""Focus on targeted prescription products for your skincare complaint. Everything else is unnecessary."" Her tips for a good routine: ""Use a cleanser you like that doesn't leave your skin feeling super tight or dry afterwards (she recommends oil cleansers for everyone as they are gentle, once a day), use an SPF in a vehicle you like during the day, and use a moisturizer that is as greasy-feeling as you can stand at night (she recommends Vaseline)."" She also recommends ditching eye creams (uses the same active ingredients as products for the whole face at the same concentrations) and the grainy exfoliator (Or anything other than glycolic or salicylic acid in general. Unless you have acne concerns, the skin exfoliates efficiently on its own and doesn't need help. These products have only a temporary effect at best and, at worst, can damage your skin's natural barrier.).

Her product recommendations may not work for you, but I think the principle of simple skincare using only a few effective ingredients is generally a sound one. As I have no concerning symptoms with my skin, I like the adage, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Since I had no issues with less frequent washing and not using actives before, I'll probably be fine if I go back to that and I'll know it's a valid and science-based choice this time. The bottom line: you don't need to spend extra cash on fancy moisturizers, serums, toners, masks or anything else. If you like the products, they are totally fine to use and not harmful. Just don't expect them to do magic.

So I'm going to try it! I'll pare down my routine and see about getting a prescription for tretinoin. And that will be all I'll use. I'll let you know how it goes in a few months!

My skin care is only:

- Clean and clear exfoliating 
- soap and glory moisturiser
